This indicates that the transformation is related to the color of the object, which is rule (2) - Color of objects.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The image features a left-to-right transformation of an object on top and three left-to-right transformations of a different object on the bottom.
2. The object on the left is brown, and the object on the right is blue.
3. The transformation on top involves a change in the color of the object, which is rule (2) - Color of objects.
4. The transformations on the bottom do not involve a change in color, so they do not match any of the given rules.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the object. In the image, the object is shown in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, or right side up. This change in orientation is a characteristic of the transformation on top.

Step-by-step reasoning:

2. As the image progresses to the right, the object is shown in a sideways orientation.
3. Finally, the object is shown in a right side up orientation on the right side.

This sequence of orientations demonstrates that the transformation on top involves a change in the orientation of the object.</s>","[Skipped mcq#2, incorrect previous response]","(D) None of the options apply

The left-to-right transformations on the bottom of the puzzle do not match the transformation on top. Each of the three transformations (A), (B), and (C) involves a change in size, orientation, or color, but none of them match the orientation change seen in the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:
