The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the objects. In the image, there are three rows of objects, and the orientation of the objects in each row changes as we move from left to right. This indicates that the transformation is related to the orientation of the objects rather than their size, number, or color.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the leftmost row, the objects are oriented vertically.
2. In the middle row, the objects are oriented horizontally.
3. In the rightmost row, the objects are oriented diagonally.

This change in orientation from left to right is a clear indication of the transformation rule (1) Orientation of objects.</s>","[Skipped mcq#2, incorrect previous response]","(A)
