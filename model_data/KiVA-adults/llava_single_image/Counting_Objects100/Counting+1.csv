The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the objects. In the image, there are three rows of objects, and the orientation of the objects in each row changes as we move from left to right. This indicates that the transformation is related to the orientation of the objects rather than their size, color, or number.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the leftmost row, the objects are oriented vertically.
2. In the middle row, the objects are oriented horizontally.
3. In the rightmost row, the objects are oriented diagonally.

This change in orientation from left to right is a clear indication of the transformation rule (1) being applied to the objects in the image.</s>","[Skipped mcq#2, incorrect previous response]","(D) None of the options apply

The transformations on the bottom involve changes in the number of objects, their orientation, or their size, but not a combination of these changes as seen in the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The left object on the bottom has two objects, while the right object has one object.
2. The left object on the bottom is positioned at the bottom left corner, while the right object is positioned at the bottom right corner.
3. The left object on the bottom has a different shape compared to the right object.
4. The left object on the bottom has a blue color, while the right object has a green color.
