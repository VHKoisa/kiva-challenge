The transformation on the top involves a change in the number of objects, while the transformations on the bottom involve changes in the size, orientation, or color of the objects. None of these transformations are the same as the transformation on the top.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation on the top involves a change in the number of objects.
2. The transformations on the bottom involve changes in the size, orientation, or color of the objects.
3. None of the transformations on the bottom are the same as the transformation on the top.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the number of objects. In the left picture, there are two objects, while in the right picture, there are three objects. This change in the number of objects indicates that the transformation is following rule (2) - the number of objects.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, there are two objects.
2. In the right picture, there are three objects.
3. The transformation involves a change in the number of objects, which is rule (2).

The puzzle on the bottom has three left-to-right transformations, and each transformation involves a change in the number of objects. This further supports the conclusion that the transformation on top follows rule (2) - the number of objects.</s>","(1) Things multiply by 3

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a change in the number of objects, which is consistent with rule (1) - things multiply by 3.
