The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the object. In the left picture, the object is facing upwards, while in the right picture, it is facing downwards. This 90-degree rotation is a characteristic of the transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The left picture shows an object facing upwards.
2. The right picture shows the same object, but it is facing downwards.
3. The transformation involves a 90-degree rotation of the object.

The left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle marked by (C) is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle. Both transformations involve a 90-degree rotation of the object.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The left picture of the object on the bottom shows it facing upwards.
2. The right picture of the object on the bottom shows it facing downwards.
3. The transformation marked by (C) involves a 90-degree rotation of the object.
4. The other transformations (A and B) do not involve a 90-degree rotation, so they are not the same as the top transformation.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the object. In the image, the object is shown in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up. This indicates that the transformation is related to the orientation of the object, which is rule (1) Orientation of objects.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The image shows the object in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up.
2. The transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object.
3. Rule (1) Orientation of objects best describes this transformation.</s>","(2) Objects turn 180 degrees

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a 180-degree rotation of the object. In the image, the object is shown in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up, which indicates that the transformation is related to a 180-degree rotation of the object.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The image shows the object in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up.
2. The transformation involves a 180-degree rotation of the object.
3. Rule (2) Objects turn 180 degrees best describes this transformation.</s>","(A)

The left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle marked by (A) is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle. In the image, the object is shown in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up, which indicates that the transformation is related to a 180-degree rotation of the object.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The image shows the object in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, and right side up.
2. The transformation on the bottom marked by (A) involves a 180-degree rotation of the object.
3. The transformation on the top of the puzzle also involves a 180-degree rotation of the object.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the object. In the left picture, the object is facing upwards, while in the right picture, it is facing downwards. This change in orientation is a characteristic of the transformation in the top row.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The left picture shows an object facing upwards.
2. The right picture shows the same object facing downwards.
3. The transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object.
4. The transformation does not involve changes in size, number, or color.

Therefore, the correct rule is (2) Orientation of objects.</s>","(2) Objects turn 90 degrees
