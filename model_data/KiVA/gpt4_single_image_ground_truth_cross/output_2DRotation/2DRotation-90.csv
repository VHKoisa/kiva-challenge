26,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning: 
- In the top sequence, the motorcycle on the left is oriented with its right side facing the viewer. 
- In the top right image, the motorcycle has been rotated so that the front is now facing the viewer. This is a quarter turn, or a 90-degree rotation.
- Looking at the bottom sequences labeled (A), (B), and (C), each shows an object (in this case, a representation of a character on a base) that changes orientation from one image to the next.
- In options (A) and (C), the character rotates by 90 degrees from the first to the second image.
- In option (B), the character is not only rotated but also depicted from a different perspective (from standing to lying down).

Based on the transformation seen in the top sequence, we can conclude that the rule best describing the left-to-right transformation on the top is objects rotating by 90 degrees.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
26,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(2)

The visual puzzle shows a motorcycle at the top which undergoes a transformation from the left image to the right image. To determine the rule that applies to this top transformation, let's analyze the change step-by-step:

1. Observe the orientation of the motorcycle in the left image: It is upright and facing toward the left.
2. Now look at the motorcycle in the right image: It is upside down and still facing left.
3. This change in orientation indicates that the motorcycle has been rotated. Since the motorcycle was initially upright and is now upside down, it has been flipped 180 degrees around an axis running from the front to the back of the motorcycle.

Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
26,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The transformation rule that best describes the left-to-right change in the top puzzle is (1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation from left to right on the top, the motorcycle is visibly rotated.
2. Noting the position of the motorcycle, the wheels that were on the bottom in the first image are now on the top in the second image.
3. The orientation of the motorcycle is a half turn or a 180-degree rotation about an axis going through the center of the motorcycle from front to back.
4. Thus, the rule that describes this transformation where the orientation of the object is reversed as if flipped upside down is a 180-degree rotation.

The conclusion is derived from observing the relative positions of distinct features of the motorcycle before and after the transformation, which clearly show the 180-degree flip.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the initial position of the dinosaur on the top left. It is standing upright.
2. Compare it to the position of the dinosaur on the top right. The dinosaur is now upside down.
3. A rotation that would turn an upright dinosaur to an upside-down position is a 180-degree rotation.
4. Therefore, the best description of the transformation from left to right on the top of the puzzle is that the object (dinosaur) rotates by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
43,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(2)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object on top from the left picture to the right picture step by step:

1. Look at the initial orientation of the dinosaur in the left image. The dinosaur is standing upright with its belly shown from the front.
2. Now, observe the orientation of the dinosaur in the right image. The dinosaur is lying on its side with its belly visible.
3. Compare the difference in orientation between the two images. There is a 90-degree rotation from the initial upright position to the lying position. This indicates that the left image has been rotated 90 degrees to arrive at the right image.

Therefore, the rule that describes the left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
43,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(2)

To solve this visual puzzle let's follow these steps:

1. Examine the top transformation of the object, which in this case is a green dinosaur. In the left image, the dinosaur is upright, standing on its legs.
2. In the right image, the dinosaur is upside down, with its legs in the air and its back on the ground. 

Considering that the object has not changed its position from left to right or front to back but has flipped entirely along the horizontal axis to be upside down, we deduce that the dinosaur rotates by 180 degrees.

Matching the observed transformation to the given rules, the correct rule that describes this transformation is:
Objects rotate by 180 degrees — which is rule number (1), not (2) as initially stated. Therefore, the correct rule is:

(1)",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
22,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(3)

To determine the appropriate rule for the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's observe the changes between the two images of the object:

- The left image of the object is a folded or curved shape with a point facing upward and a wider, rounded bottom facing downward.
- The right image shows the same object, but now it has rotated such that the point that was previously facing upward is now facing the right.

The transformation doesn't show a full 90 or 180-degree rotation, nor does it show any change that doesn't correspond to a rotation. Instead, it appears that the orientation of the object simply shifts to provide a different view, while the object itself doesn't rotate with respect to its central axis.

Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that there is no change between the pictures – the object merely shifts to present a different view without actually rotating around its center. This would correspond to rule number (3) No change between pictures.",0,No change between pictures
22,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle is (2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top puzzle, we see an object on the left and a different orientation of the same object on the right.
- The object on the left is a fortune cookie with the opening facing downwards and slightly to the left.
- The object on the right is the same fortune cookie rotated, with the opening now facing towards the right side.
- The rotation between the two positions of the fortune cookie appears to be 90 degrees clockwise.
- This matches with rule (2), which states that objects rotate by 90 degrees.

So, the answer is (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
22,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle. It appears to be a fortune cookie, which in the left image has its opening facing the top left, and in the right image, the opening is facing the bottom right.

2. Since the orientation of the main features (the opening) of the fortune cookie has changed from top left to bottom right, it indicates that the object has undergone a half-turn or 180-degree rotation around its central axis.

3. This transformation is consistent with a 180-degree rotation, meaning the object has been flipped over to its opposite side.

4. Therefore, rule (1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees applies to the transformation seen in the top of the puzzle.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

I will now provide step-by-step reasoning for choosing this rule:

1. I will examine the transformation of the object at the top, which is a sofa.
2. The sofa on the left is shown in an upright position, with the armrest and cushions visible from the top.
3. The sofa on the right is inverted, with the bottom of the sofa facing up. This means we now see the underside of the armrest and what would normally be the part of the sofa touching the floor.
4. To shift from the first orientation to the second, the sofa would need to be rotated 180 degrees around a horizontal axis running left to right. This would flip the sofa in such a way that the top becomes the bottom.
5. Therefore, the rule that describes this transformation is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
24,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the image at the top of the puzzle, you can see a sofa that is oriented normally on the left.
2. On the right, the same sofa is rotated, and if we look closely, we can infer that it is a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise from the original position, because the backside of the sofa that was initially vertical is now horizontal.
3. The direction of the shadow on the floor in both images also suggests that the light source remains consistent, providing further evidence that this is a rotation rather than a flip or any other transformation.
4. By comparing these two images of the sofa, we can rule out options (1), (3), and (4) as they do not describe a 90-degree rotation. The 180-degree rotation would have placed the sofa upside down, no change between pictures is clearly not the case, and since there is a consistent rule applied, option (4) doesn't apply is incorrect.
5. Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation from the left picture to the right picture of the sofa is a 90-degree rotation, which corresponds to rule number (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top, which in this case is a couch.

- In the left image, the couch is upright, in its standard orientation.
- In the right image, the couch has been rotated. The bottom side of the couch that was in contact with the floor (or invisible support) is now facing up, and the top part of the couch we would normally lean against is now facing down.

The couch has undergone a half-turn rotation, which is equivalent to being rotated by 180 degrees from the left to the right image. From this, we conclude that the correct rule describing the transformation from the left to the right image in the top puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The visual puzzle provided illustrates a transformation of an object on top with two images and below are three sets of transformations, each marked as (A), (B), or (C). We need to determine the transformation rule that applies to the object on the top of the puzzle.

Let's analyze the transformation from the first image to the second image at the top of the puzzle:

1. The object appears to be a walkie-talkie.
2. In the first image, the antenna of the walkie-talkie is pointing upwards.
3. In the second image, the antenna is pointing to the right.
4. This change of orientation from up to right corresponds to a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Therefore, the transformation rule that applies to the top images is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees. The correct rule number, as per the options provided, is (1).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
12,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(2)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's look at the top transformation.

1. The object is a walkie-talkie. In the left image, the antenna is pointing upwards, and we can see the front part of the walkie-talkie with buttons and screen.
2. In the right image, the antenna is pointing towards us, which means the walkie-talkie has been rotated.
3. To determine the angle of rotation, we notice that we have gone from seeing the front of the walkie-talkie to seeing the top, which would be a 90-degree rotation around the horizontal axis going from left to right through the walkie-talkie.
4. Thus, the transformation rule that applies here is that the object rotates by 90 degrees.

Hence, the correct rule number to describe the transformation is (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
12,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(2)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top sequence, the object, which is a walkie-talkie, undergoes a transformation from the left to the right image.
2. The antenna that was initially pointing upwards is pointing to the right in the second image.
3. If you mentally rotate the walkie-talkie in the first image 90 degrees clockwise, the antenna will point to the right, matching the orientation of the walkie-talkie in the second image.
4. This transformation follows a 90 degrees rotation. Other elements such as buttons and the overall shape also align with a 90-degree rotation.
5. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
