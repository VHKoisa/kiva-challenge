To solve this visual puzzle, let's look at the transformation of the object on the top, from left to right, which in this case, happens to be Sonic the Hedgehog. 

- On the left, we see Sonic standing upright. 
- On the right, Sonic has been turned upside down, which is a rotation of 180 degrees around the axis that goes from the left to right side (or from his front to his back).

Now we compare this transformation to the rules provided:
- (1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees: This rule matches the transformation observed for Sonic as he is upside down in the second image.
- (2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees: This doesn't match, as Sonic isn't rotated by just 90 degrees.
- (3) No change between pictures: This rule is not applicable, as there is a change from the first picture to the second.
- (4) Doesn't apply: Since rule (1) is already matching, rule (4) isn't necessary to consider.

Hence, the correct rule describing the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle is (1), as Sonic has indeed been rotated by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
20,1,0,90,0,90,"(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
- The top pair of images shows a character that appears to be rotated by 180 degrees from left to right.
- On the left, the character is standing upright.
- On the right, the character is upside down, suggesting that the character was flipped over a horizontal axis.
- This rotation matches the description of a 180-degree rotation.
- To verify this, we compare the transformation at the top with the transformations presented at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C).
- Option (A) demonstrates no change in orientation.
- Option (B) shows a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (C) appears to show a 180-degree rotation, matching the transformation of the character at the top.
- Thus, the rule that objects rotate by 180 degrees is the one that best describes the visual transformation from the left to the right in the top part of the puzzle.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
20,2,0,90,0,90,"(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- In the top transformation, the starting position shows the object, which appears to be a character, standing upright.
- In the ending position on the right, the same character is shown upside down, which indicates a half-turn or 180-degree rotation.
- This observation of the character flipping from an upright position to an upside-down position aligns with rule (1), suggesting that the object undergoes a 180-degree rotation. 

This conclusion is based solely on the orientation change from the left image to the right image in the top row, disregarding any other changes or properties that may also be present.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
8,0,0,90,0,90,"(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To determine this, let's perform a step-by-step visual analysis of the transformation:

1. Examine the initial position of the object on the top left: It is an upright figure standing on its feet.
2. Look at the position of the object on the top right: The figure is now lying on its back with its front facing upwards, which indicates a rotation along the longitudinal axis.
3. Assess the nature of the rotation: The change from standing to lying flat on the back with the front side up suggests that the figure has been rotated by 180 degrees along the longitudinal axis.

Thus, this top transformation aligns with rule (1), where the object rotates by 180 degrees.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To determine the rule governing the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's analyze the position and orientation of the object, which is an action figure of Spider-Man.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. In the left image, Spider-Man is standing upright.
2. In the right image, Spider-Man has been rotated to lie flat on his back.

This indicates that the figure of Spider-Man has experienced a rotation, and since he goes from standing to lying flat, the direction of the rotation appears to be about the horizontal axis in the image plane. The Spider-Man figure rotates by 90 degrees if we consider the axis to be along the line of sight from a viewer directly in front of the figure.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is ""Objects rotate by 90 degrees,"" which corresponds to rule (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
8,2,0,90,0,90,"(2)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's first analyze the transformation of the object on top (depicted by the Spider-Man figure). The figure on the left is upright, and the figure on the right is lying on its back with its front facing up.

The top transformation of the figure shows a rotation that appears to be around its longitudinal axis. This means the figure has been rotated such that the front, which was facing the observer, is now facing upwards. This implies a 180-degree rotation around the axis running from the head to the feet of the figure.

None of the options (1), (3), or (4) accurately describe this observation, as they suggest either a 90-degree rotation, no change, or non-applicability, none of which match the visible rotation. Therefore, rule number (2) ""Objects rotate by 180 degrees"" is the one that best describes the transformation seen in the top figures of the puzzle.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To describe the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's examine the two images of the house:

- In the left image, the house is upright with its roof on top and the door facing directly towards us.
- In the right image, the house is upside down with its roof now at the bottom and the door is still facing directly towards us.

This change from the left image to the right image indicates that the house was rotated by 180 degrees around a horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the house. Therefore, the rule that objects rotate by 180 degrees describes the transformation from the left to the right picture at the top of the puzzle.",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle step-by-step:

1. Observe the initial position of the object, which is a red barn-like structure.
2. Look at the resulting position of the object on the right.
3. Compare the two images to understand the type of movement.
4. Upon comparison, it's evident that the barn has rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

Hence, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle is that objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule (1).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
28,2,0,90,0,90,"(2)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the top transformation, which involves a red house. The house appears upright on the left and on its side on the right.

2. Note the key features that change from the left picture to the right picture: the orientation of the house changes by 90 degrees, as the house has been rotated clockwise.

3. Compare this transformation to the given rules. The house has not rotated by 180 degrees, so rule (1) is not a match. It has undergone more than no change (rule 3) and it clearly adheres to one of the rules (so rule 4 does not apply).

4. The only rule that matches the observed transformation is the 90-degree rotation, which is rule (2). Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation of the house is a 90-degree rotation.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top part of the puzzle, we observe a duck in the first image and a squirrel in the second image.
- When comparing the duck's position to the squirrel's, we notice that the duck is facing to the left while the squirrel is facing up. This indicates that the duck has been rotated in a way that now its original left side is facing upward.
- The duck's rotation to become the orientation of the squirrel involves a 90-degree turn counter-clockwise assuming we start from the perspective of the duck.
- None of the other rules (180-degree rotation, no change, or doesn't apply) fit the observed transformation.
- The bottom part of the puzzle with transformation options (A), (B), and (C) is not relevant to determining the rule for the top part, as per the instructions. We are only analyzing the top transformation to discern the rule.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object on top, which shows a duck on the left and a squirrel on the right. The key is to determine the nature of the transformation from left to right. Here, I'll analyze step by step:

1. **Orientation**: The duck is oriented with its front facing to the left, and the squirrel is facing to the right. This indicates a change in orientation.
   
2. **Rotation**: By comparing positions, it appears the duck would have to rotate to face the opposite direction in order to match the orientation of the squirrel. The front of the duck (where the beak is) becomes the front of the squirrel (where the head is), so this is a horizontal rotation.
   
3. **Degrees of Rotation**: The duck has rotated 90 degrees around its vertical axis to face the opposite direction, which is confirmed by looking at the front of the duck and the front of the squirrel.

Based on this analysis, we can determine that the rule describing the top row transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning for choosing rule (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees for the top transformation:

1. Examine the top section of the visual puzzle where there is an image of a rubber duck on the left and a squirrel on the right.

2. Observe the orientation of the rubber duck. It is facing to the right.

3. Look at the orientation of the squirrel. It is facing upwards.

4. Compare the direction the duck is facing (right) to the direction the squirrel is facing (up). The change in direction from right to up is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation in a clockwise direction.

5. Since the transformation from the duck to the squirrel involves a 90-degree rotation, the rule that best describes the transformation is rule (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle is the object rotating by 90 degrees. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially, observe the left-most image on the top of the puzzle, which shows a gray couch photographed from a certain angle.
2. Now, looking at the right-most image on the top, the couch has been rotated. To determine the rotation, consider the orientation of the couch's armrests and the cushions.
3. The couch in the first image has its armrests on the left and the right, but in the second image, the armrests appear at the top and bottom, implying a quarter turn.
4. This quarter turn corresponds to a 90-degree rotation about an axis perpendicular to the initial orientation.
5. Therefore, rule number (2), which states that objects rotate by 90 degrees, is the correct rule for the transformation depicted in the top part of the puzzle.",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Start by looking at the object on the top of the puzzle, we have a grey sofa that is transforming from left to right.

2. In the left image, the sofa appears to be viewed from one corner, the armrest closest to the viewer is on the left, and the sofa extends back and to the right.

3. In the right image, the orientation of the sofa has changed. The previously visible armrest is now on the right side, and the sofa seems to extend back and to the left. This suggests the sofa has been rotated.

4. Analyze the degree of rotation by comparing the elements of the sofa in both pictures. The armrest that was initially on the left is now on the right, and the overall orientation appears to have flipped.

5. The change in orientation indicates that the sofa has undergone a rotation. Since the top of the sofa is now facing towards where the bottom was, this points to a 180-degree rotation.

6. Comparing this observation to the provided rules, the transformation that most accurately describes the change from the left to the right picture of the sofa is a rotation by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (2).",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to analyze the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle:

1. Look at the orientation of the object on the left - it is a straight couch facing upwards.
2. Now look at the object on the right - it is the same couch but now rotated. 
3. To determine the degree of rotation, consider the armrests and the cushion arrangement of the couch. Initially, the armrests are on the left and right with the three cushions arranged horizontally. After transformation, the armrests are on the top and bottom, with the three cushions arranged vertically. 
4. This shows that the couch has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise from its original position.

Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation is a 90-degree rotation, which corresponds to rule number (2).",1,Objects rotate by 90 degrees
