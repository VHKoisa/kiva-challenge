To solve this visual puzzle, let's go through step-by-step reasoning by looking at the transformation occurring in the top portion and applying that logic to the bottom set of transformations:

1. The image on the top shows an object (a submarine) being reflected left-to-right. This means that the right side becomes the left side and vice versa; essentially, it's a mirrored image across a vertical axis.

2. Let's apply this transformation rule to each of the three pairs of fish in the bottom portion of the puzzle:

    A. The left fish is reflected along a vertical axis to become the right fish. This is an accurate reflection, as all features of the fish are mirrored across this axis.
    
    B. The transformation here is not simply a reflection. The fish on the right has been rotated instead of being reflected.
    
    C. The fish on the right has been flipped upside down, not reflected across a vertical axis.

3. Comparing these transformations with the one provided at the top, we establish that option (A) is the correct transformation to match the one shown at the top. It reflects the image along a vertical axis, which results in a mirrored image on the right, just like the transformation of the submarine. Options (B) and (C) depict different types of transformations that do not match the mirror reflection demonstrated in the top part of the puzzle.",0,No change
48,1,0,Y,0,Y,"(C)

To solve this visual puzzle, we must analyze the transformation presented on the top of the puzzle and then apply that transformation logic to the three sets of objects provided on the bottom, to find the set that undergoes an identical transformation. The top of the puzzle shows a submarine on the left side, which is reflected from left to right to become the image on the right side. This is a horizontal reflection (left-right mirror image).

Now, let's examine the transformations of the objects on the bottom:

- (A) shows a fish facing to the right and the resultant image shows an identical fish still facing to the right. There is no left-right reflection occurring here.
- (B) shows a fish facing to the right and the resultant image is a fish facing to the left, but it is not a mirror image; the fish's fins are on the bottom in both pictures. This indicates that the fish has been rotated or flipped top to bottom, not reflected left to right.
- (C) shows a fish facing to the right and the resultant image is a mirror image with the fish facing to the left. This matches the top transformation, where the right side becomes the left side and vice versa in a mirror image.

Given that option (C) is the only transformation that matches the horizontal reflection (left-right mirror image) presented on the top of the puzzle, it is the correct answer.",1,Y
28,0,0,Y,0,Y,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top shows a barn that is reflected left-right to become the barn on the right. Specifically, features like the doors and windows swap sides, but they remain unchanged in every other aspect—orientation, color, shape, etc.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:

   - Option (A) shows a character that is not flipped left-right; instead, the character appears twice with the same orientation in both images.

   - Option (B) also shows the character in the same orientation in both images with no reflection occurring.

   - Option (C) shows the character initially standing upright, but in the second image, the character is upside down.

3. The character in option (C) has undergone a clear transformation where the top has become the bottom and vice versa. If you imagine a mirror placed horizontally at the character's feet in the first image, the second image is what you would see reflected. This is a reflection similar to the barn's reflection, but it happens along a horizontal axis instead of a vertical one.

4. Although the axis of reflection is different (horizontal for the character vs. vertical for the barn), the type of transformation is the same: a reflection that swaps top and bottom for the character, and left and right for the barn.

Therefore, the correct answer, given the understanding that the reflection occurs in a different orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), is (C).",0,X
48,2,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for my choice:

1. The top transformation shows a navy-blue submarine facing left reflected to face right. This is a simple left-right reflection, with no other changes applied to the object.

2. Now, I'll examine the three transformations on the bottom labeled (A), (B), and (C).

   - Transformation (A): The fish in the first image is facing upwards and to the left. After the transformation, the fish is still facing upwards but now to the right. This is not only a reflection but also a change in the orientation of the fish from facing left to facing right while keeping the upward direction constant. This does not match the transformation on the top because there is no change in the inclination of the submarine.

   - Transformation (B): The fish in the first image is facing to the left. After the transformation, the fish is reflected to face to the right without any other changes in its orientation or position. This matches the kind of transformation we see at the top with the submarine.

   - Transformation (C): The fish in the first image is facing down and to the left. After the transformation, the fish is still facing down but now to the right. Like in (A), this transformation includes a reflection and also retains the downward direction of the fish. Again, this does not match the submarine's transformation, which includes no change in inclination.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one",0,X
28,1,0,Y,0,Y,"The answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We are looking for a transformation where the left image is reflected left-to-right to become the image on the right.

2. In the top transformation, the left side of the barn is red with a small window, and the right side has a large yellow area and a door. When it's reflected, the red side with the small window is now on the right, and the large yellow area with the door is on the left, indicating a mirrored image along the vertical axis.

3. Now let's examine the bottom transformations:

   - (A) shows a character right-side-up on the left and upside-down on the right, which is not a left-right reflection.
   
   - (B) shows the character with its arm extended up and to its right on the left, and with the arm extended up and to its left on the right side (reflecting the character's left and right), which matches the type of reflection shown in the example with the barn.
   
   - (C) shows the character with its arm extended up and to its right on both sides, which is not a reflection but a repetition.

Therefore, the only transformation that matches the left-to-right reflection of the top object is (B).",1,Y
42,0,0,Y,0,Y,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation shown on top and apply the same reasoning to the three options (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

The top transformation shows an object (a croissant) being reflected left-to-right. This means the right side of the croissant in the left image becomes the left side in the right image and vice versa (a mirror image across the vertical axis).

Now let's analyze the options:

(A) - The left and right images appear to be identical. There is no left-to-right reflection; they are the same, so this is not the correct transformation.

(B) - The left and right images are mirrored versions of each other, similar to the transformation shown at the top of the puzzle. The orientation of the flowers and leaves is reversed in the left-to-right direction.

(C) - The right image has rotated the flowers and leaves rather than reflecting them as a mirror image; therefore, this is not the same transformation as the one at the top.

The only option that reflects the same type of transformation (left-to-right reflection) as the one on the top of the puzzle is (B).",0,No change
28,2,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation: The barn’s transformation from left to right is a left-right reflection, which is like a mirror image. The right side of the original becomes the left side in the transformation, and the left side of the original becomes the right side.

2. Now examine option (A): The character is flipped upside down from left to right. This is not a left-right reflection, so (A) is not the correct transformation.

3. Examine option (B): The character is reflected left-right. The positions of the character's arms and the orientation of the face and body parts have been mirrored, which is consistent with the transformation shown at the top with the barn. This matches the original transformation criteria.

4. Examine option (C): The character is the same in both the left and the right images, with no transformation applied. This does not match the original transformation criteria.

Thus, the only transformation that matches the top left-right reflection is option (B).",0,No change
42,1,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the transformation of the object at the top:
   - The croissant is reflected along a vertical axis, resulting in a mirrored image that shows a left-right transformation.

2. Compare this transformation to each of the three transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:
   - (A) features a plant with flowers where the second image does not mirror the first; it appears rotated and altered in formation rather than being a simple reflection.
   - (B) features the same plant with flowers, and here the second image is a mirrored reflection of the first image, maintaining the same layout of the flowers and leaves, just reversed.
   - (C) is like (A), as the second image of the plant with flowers is not simply mirrored but altered in the distribution of the flowers.

3. The only transformation that mirrors the original left-right reflection of the croissant is option (B).",1,Y
49,0,0,Y,0,Y,"(A)

To solve this visual puzzle, I'll break down the transformation we see in the example at the top:

1. The ship on the left shows its port side (left side), with the bow (front) of the ship pointing to the left.
2. The ship on the right is a left-right reflection of the first. Now, the ship shows its starboard side (right side), with the bow still pointing to the left because it has been mirrored along the vertical axis.

Now, looking at the three sets of transformations for the different object at the bottom, we're looking for a similar left-right reflection:

- Option (A) shows the object with a small tab or protrusion pointing up on the left. After transformation, the object's reflection shows the tab pointing down, which is a correct left-right mirror reflection, where the tab acts like the ship's bow and retains its orientation in relation to the ""front"" direction (to the left in the original position).
- Option (B) is incorrect because the object is not a left-right reflection; rather, it seems to be rotated, which is not the same transformation we see in the ship example.
- Option (C) is also incorrect because the object has been mirrored top-to-bottom instead of left-to-right.

Hence, option (A) is the only correct transformation that matches the example given with the ship.",0,X
42,2,0,Y,0,Y,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to identify which of the three transformations (A), (B), or (C) is the same as the top transformation where the croissant is flipped horizontally (a left-right reflection).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Start by looking at the croissant on the top of the puzzle. The left picture of the croissant is the original position, and the right picture shows the croissant after being reflected from left to right.

2. We apply the same concept to the objects at the bottom. We are looking for an option where the object is mirrored horizontally.

3. Option (A) shows two identical images side by side with no flip or reflection.

4. Option (C) shows the same; the bouquet of flowers is identical on both sides with no reflection or flip.

5. Option (B) shows a bouquet of flowers that is reflected or flipped horizontally from the left image to the right image, just like the croissant.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) because it demonstrates the same left-to-right reflection as the transformation shown with the croissant on the top of the puzzle.",0,X
49,1,0,Y,0,Y,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, we see a ship that is reflected left-to-right. This transformation involves flipping the image along its vertical axis.

2. Now, let's examine the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle:

   - Option (A) shows two images of the object where there is no obvious change. It is not a left-right reflection.
   - Option (B) also shows two images of the object where the details and orientation appear flipped in the mirror-image sense, which is the left-right reflection we are looking for.
   - Option (C) shows two images of the object with the second image rotated 90 degrees around the axis which is a rotation, not a reflection.

3. Only the transformation in option (B) matches the type of transformation seen at the top of the puzzle, which is a left-right reflection.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",1,Y
12,0,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (A).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- In the top transformation, we observe a walkie-talkie is being reflected left-to-right. This is akin to a mirror image being created along the vertical axis running through the center of the object.
- Looking at the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom, we're looking to identify which one also represents a simple left-to-right reflection.
  
  - In option (A), the cake displays a reflection across its vertical central axis, just like the walkie-talkie above. The text on the top of the cake flips direction from facing left to facing right, which matches the type of transformation the walkie-talkie experiences.
 
  - Option (B) appears not to be a transformation but identical images. There's no left-to-right reflection shown here.
  
  - Option (C) also doesn't show left-to-right reflection as the left and right images are exact copies and not mirror images of each other.
  
Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top with the walkie-talkie is indeed option (A), with the cake showing a left-to-right reflection.",0,X
49,2,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

Looking at the top transformation, the left-side image of the ship is mirrored to become the right-side image. This mirrored reflection can be observed by noticing how the features of the ship that are on the left in the original are now on the right in the transformed image, and vice versa. Key identifying features like the sails and shape of the hull swap sides.

Now, we examine the three bottom transformations to see which transformation follows the same pattern:

(A) The left image of the knob is simply rotated to end up upside down on the right. This is not a left-right reflection transformation, therefore A is not the answer.

(B) The left image of the knob has a tab on the left side that, in the right image, is reflected to the right side. This matches the type of transformation seen with the ship on top – a left-right reflection. 

(C) The left image of the knob has the tab on the left side, and it remains on the left side in the right image. The right image is simply turned a bit counterclockwise but does not reflect the tab to the opposite side, which means it is not a mirrored reflection like the transformation at the top.

Only option (B) shows the same left-right reflection transformation as the transformation of the ship on top.",0,No change
12,1,0,Y,0,Y,"(B)

The top transformation shows an object which is reflected horizontally (left-to-right), flipping it like a mirror image. Now, we can examine the transformations of the objects marked with (A), (B), and (C) to see which one matches this description.

(A) This transformation shows a simple rotation of the object, without a mirror-like reflection. The text ""Happy Birthday"" and design elements remain oriented in the same way relative to the observer, and the object itself is not flipped horizontally (like a reflection).

(B) This transformation shows the object being reflected horizontally. We can see that the text ""Happy Birthday"" and other design elements have been flipped as though looking into a mirror, which is the same type of transformation as the example on the top with the walkie-talkie.

(C) Like (A), this transformation involves rotation without a horizontal reflection. The ""Happy Birthday"" text and design maintain the same orientation to the viewer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only transformation that reflects the object horizontally as shown in the top example.",0,X
44,0,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (C).

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the puzzle:

1. Observe the top transformation, which shows a mug from a left view that is reflected to become a right view of the mug. This operation is a left-right reflection, creating a mirror image of the mug.

2. Option (A) shows a pig viewed from one side, and then the second image appears to be the same pig rotated slightly, not a mirror reflection.

3. Option (B) shows a pig viewed from one side, and the second image appears to be the same pig but viewed from a slightly different angle, also not a mirror reflection.

4. Option (C) shows a pig viewed from one side, and the second image is the mirror image of the first, just like the mug in the top transformation.

Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because it represents the same left-right reflection or mirror image transformation that is demonstrated on top with the mug.",0,X
12,2,0,Y,0,Y,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows an object (a walkie-talkie) that is reflected along its vertical axis. The left side becomes the right side and vice versa, effectively swapping the apparent orientation of any asymmetric features.

2. Comparing the bottom transformations:
- (A) shows no transformation; the object (a cake) is the same in both images.
- (B) shows a rotation along a vertical axis situated at the front of the object. This is not a reflection but rather a rotation, and the text remains readable, indicating it is not mirrored.
- (C) shows the object mirrored along its vertical axis in a similar manner to the object on the top. The text that was legible in the original orientation is reversed in the reflection, just like in the walkie-talkie reflection.

3. Since (C) is the only option that demonstrates the same type of left-right reflection as the one on the top, the answer is (C).",0,X
44,1,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (B).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top shows a mug being reflected across a vertical axis such that the left side becomes the right and the right side becomes the left.

2. Looking at the transformations on the bottom:

- Option (A) shows the pig simply being rotated to its right, but it is not a left-right reflection.
- Option (B) shows the pig being flipped along a vertical axis, which is a left-right reflection similar to the one shown at the top with the mug.
- Option (C) shows the pig being translated (moved) to the right without any rotational or reflectional changes.

3. Since we are looking for a left-right reflection, the only transformation that matches the puzzle at the top is option (B).",0,X

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- First, let's analyze the top transformation: The rabbit on the left is facing to the viewer's right with its right paw slightly lifted. In the reflected image on the right, the rabbit is facing the viewer's left with its left paw slightly lifted, which is consistent with a left-right reflection.

- Now let's examine the options on the bottom of the puzzle:
  - Option (A) shows two images of a cup with what seems to be ice cream scoops on it. The left image and the right image appear to be the same; there's no reflection or significant change.
  - Option (B) shows the cup from a top view on the left, and a side view on the right. This is a change in perspective, not a reflection.
  - Option (C) shows a left-right reflection. The left image has a scoop with pink toppings on the left and a scoop with darker toppings on the right. In the right image, the positions of the differently topped scoops are switched, which is consistent with a left-right mirror reflection.

Given that the top transformation is a left-right reflection and only option (C) represents a similar left-right reflection, the answer is (C).",1,Y

In the puzzle you provided, the transformation from left to right involves a left-right reflection, which is also known as a horizontal flip.

Let's analyze the transformations for each of the options step-by-step:

- Option (A): The pig is shown on the left with its head pointing to the left. On the right, the pig has been reflected but also rotated, as indicated by the position of the legs and the orientation of its snout and ears; this seems incorrect given the example with the mug shows only a reflection and not a rotation.
  
- Option (B): The pig is shown on the left with its head pointing to the left, and on the right, the pig has been reflected left-to-right. The snout and ears are now pointing right, and the reflection matches the pose of the left image, much like the mug example at the top of the puzzle.

- Option (C): The pig on the left has its head pointing left, and on the right, the pig has been reflected. However, the right-side pig has also been slightly rotated as the position of the legs doesn't match a simple reflection, similar to option (A).

Thus, the correct option that represents the same left-to-right transformation seen with the mug is option (B), where the pig has been horizontally flipped without any additional rotation.",0,No change

To solve this puzzle, let's perform an analysis step by step:

1. Look at the transformation on the top of the puzzle with the rabbit figure. The left image of the rabbit is a normal view, and the right image is a left-right reflection of the same rabbit. Specifically, we can tell it's a left-right reflection because the rabbit's right ear (our visual left) is bent in the first image, and then it appears on the opposite side (our visual right) in the reflected image.

2. Now, examine each set of images marked as (A), (B), and (C) to determine which showcases the same type of left-right reflection.

(A) - The left image shows two ice cream scoops with pink and chocolate on top. In the reflected image, we see the bowl from the top, and based on this angle, we cannot determine if a left-right reflection occurred. The transformation here is a rotation, not a reflection.

(B) - The left image displays the ice cream bowl with a particular arrangement of scoops. The right image is the same bowl, but the pink scoop has changed places with the chocolate scoop, indicating a left-right reflection—this matches the type of transformation seen with the rabbit.

(C) - The pair of images seems to be identical, indicating there's no left-right reflection or any other noticeable change.

Therefore, the transformation in (B) is the same as the transformation at the top of the puzzle with the",1,Y

To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the top transformation first:

1. The object on the left has the number ""2"" on its body and is facing us with blue wheels on both sides and an orange antenna on top.
2. In the transformed image on the right, the object is mirrored left to right. The ""2"" is now reversed to become ""S"", the wheels are on the opposite sides as expected from a left-to-right reflection, and the antenna remains at the top unchanged.

Now, let's analyze the bottom transformations:

(A) The slice of pizza loses a piece from the left side and has a new piece on the right side. This is not a reflection; it's the addition and removal of parts.
(B) The pizza slice changes from having a missing piece on the right to having it on the left, which looks similar to a reflection, but the toppings change positions relative to the slices, unlike a mirror image where they should stay in place but be reflected as well.
(C) The pizza slice shows a straightforward left-to-right mirroring. The missing piece is reflected to the opposite side while maintaining the arrangement of the toppings, consistent with how the top transformation occurs.

Therefore, (C) demonstrates the same type of transformation (mirrored left-right) as the object on the top of the puzzle.",1,Y
36,1,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation from the left to right at the top of the puzzle involves a left-right flip or reflection of the object. We can observe that the number ""2"" on the object's body flips horizontally and becomes an ""S"" as a result of the reflection.

2. We need to find which of the three lower transformations represent a similar left-right reflection.

3. Option (A) shows the pizza with a slice missing on the bottom left before the transformation, and after the transformation, the slice is missing on the bottom right. This indicates that it has undergone a left-right reflection.

4. Option (B) cannot be correct because the position of the slices has changed, indicating a rotational transformation, not a reflection.

5. Option (C) cannot be correct either because the slice that is missing stays on the same side before and after, which suggests the pizza has not been flipped or reflected.

Let's solve the visual puzzle step by step:

1. The top part of the puzzle shows a transformation of an object (in this case, a bunny figure) that has been reflected left to right. The right side of the object in the first image becomes the left side in the second image, and vice versa.

2. Now, let's examine the three options (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle:

   - (A) shows an ice cream with three scoops. The left image is a direct mirror image of the right—what's on the left in the first becomes the right in the second, matching the transformation shown at the top with the bunny.
   
   - (B) shows a top-down rotation of the ice cream. The sprinkles that are on the top in the first image move to the bottom in the second image, so it does not follow the same kind of transformation as the one on top.
   
   - (C) shows the same image repeated, which means there's no transformation taking place, unlike the example with the bunny at the top.

2. In option (A), the left-right reflection does not occur as the numbers and the orientation of the clock remain the same in both images.

3. In option (C), the left-right reflection results in the clock being upside down, which is not the same transformation as the one seen with the cactus. The cactus keeps its original orientation in its reflection.

4. In option (B), the left-right reflection mirrors the clock correctly—the numbers are reversed as should be the case in a left-right reflection, while the orientation (upright position) of the clock remains consistent with the transformation of the cactus at the top.

    - On the left, the duck has the number ""2"" and the wheels are on the right-hand side.
    - On the right, there is a mirror-image transformation. The ""2"" becomes an ""S"" as it's a reverse, and the wheels are now reflected to the left-hand side.

2. Bottom Transformations (Pizza slices):
    - We need to look for a transformation that represents the same type of change as the top transformation.

    (A) This is not a reflection. The slice is simply rotated to create an appearance of fewer bites taken.
    (B) This exhibits a mirror-image reflection. The bite marks are now on the opposite side, just like the duck's wheels.
    (C) This is another non-reflective transformation, similar to (A), where the slice is rotated or viewed from a different angle but not reflected.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a lion facing left, and on the right side, it's the same lion reflected to face right. This means that the transformation involves a left-right reflection.

   - (C) shows a guitar facing left and then the same guitar also facing left, which does not indicate any reflection or change in direction.

3. The only option that matches the same left-to-right reflection transformation as the one on top is (B).

To solve this visual puzzle, let's step through the transformation that occurs from left to right in the example on the top with the cactus, and then apply the same logic to the three transformations of the clocks marked (A), (B), and (C).

- The cactus on the top of the puzzle is flipped horizontally (left-to-right) in the image on the right. This is a mirror image along the vertical axis.

Now, let's examine the transformations of the clocks:

- In option (A), the clock is also flipped horizontally. It becomes a mirror image along the vertical axis, just like the transformation that occurred with the cactus.

- In option (B), the clock is not simply flipped; the numbers inside the clock face have been rotated as if the clock has been turned but the surface we see remains the same orientation. This is not the same transformation as the one on top.

- In option (C), the clock is flipped vertically, not horizontally. This results in an upside-down mirror image, which is again different from the transformation shown on top.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it is the only transformation that shows a horizontal flip, creating a mirror image along the vertical axis, which matches the transformation of the cactus shown at the top of the puzzle.",0,X
21,1,0,Y,0,Y,"(C)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation process presented at the top of the puzzle and then apply the same process to the three options presented at the bottom.

Top puzzle transformation (Lion):
1. We see a lion facing left in the initial image.
2. In the transformed image, the lion is mirrored, now facing right. The body orientation has flipped on the vertical axis.

Now let's examine the lower transformations, one by one:

(A) The electric guitar is seen from its front side in the first image, and it remains in the same orientation in the second image. This is not the same transformation as the lion since the object did not change orientation.

(B) Similar to option (A), the electric guitar retains its front-facing orientation between the first and the second image. Again, this is not a mirror image.

(C) The guitar in the first image shows the front side, but in the second image, the object changes to a key, which is seen from a different viewpoint and with different features.

The key to solving this puzzle is not looking for the same object but rather identifying a different object in the corresponding position and finding a transformation that mirrors the original transformation process of flipping orientation. Given that none of the guitar transformations involve a mirror image flip, the correct answer has to be one that does not follow the example on top.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C), as it is the only option that represents a change to a different object,",0,X
21,2,0,Y,0,Y,"The correct answer is (C).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The puzzle requires identifying the transformation that shows a left-right reflection of an object.
- In the top example, a lion is shown facing left and then reflected to face right. The reflection results in the same lion appearing mirrored along a vertical axis.
  
For each item marked (A), (B), and (C):
- (A) shows two identical guitars facing the same direction, which does not demonstrate a left-right reflection.
- (B) shows a guitar and its headstock reflected around a vertical axis, but the body of the guitar does not appear, indicating that it's not just a simple left-right reflection.
- (C) shows a guitar facing left and then the same guitar reflected to face right, which is exactly the transformation that the lion in the top example underwent.

Therefore, the transformation in (C) matches the transformation shown at the top of the puzzle.",0,No change
