43,0,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we see a dinosaur figurine that is facing up and, after a 90-degree rotation, is transformed into a dinosaur lying face down.

2. We need to look for the same type of transformation in the options (A), (B), and (C).

3. In option (A), the gingerbread man figurine rotates from facing left to facing upward; this is a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise, which is not the same as the top transformation, where the object is rotated to lie on its back.

4. In option (B), the gingerbread man starts off standing upright and, after a 90-degree rotation clockwise, is lying on its back facing down. This mirrors the transformation seen with the dinosaur figurine on top.

5. In option (C), the gingerbread man is rotated from facing right to facing upward; this is a 90-degree rotation clockwise, which is not the same as the top transformation where the dinosaur ends up on its back.

Therefore, option (B) is the only one that matches the top transformation, which is a 90-degree rotation resulting in the object lying flat on its back.",0,180
43,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation that occurs from the left image to the right image on the top row and then apply the same logic to the images on the bottom row.

Top Row Transformation (Example):
1. The dinosaur on the left is upright and facing the right.
2. The dinosaur on the right is lying on its belly and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Now, let's apply this transformation logic to the bottom rows:

A. The gingerbread man rotates counterclockwise and flips over (incorrect).
B. The gingerbread man rotates 90 degrees clockwise and is now lying on its belly (correct).
C. The gingerbread man both flips over and rotates, which does not match the sample transformation.

The transformation in option (B) matches the example transformation of the dinosaur on the top row, hence the correct answer is (B).",0,180
43,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we have an object (a green dinosaur) that rotates 90 degrees clockwise to move from the left image to the right image.

2. Looking at the options (A), (B), and (C), we are trying to determine which one also represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

3. Option (A) shows no rotation; the object (a gingerbread man) on the right is a mirror image of the one on the left.
4. Option (B) shows the object on the right flipped upside down from the object on the left, which is a 180-degree rotation, not 90 degrees.
5. Option (C) shows the object on the right has turned 90 degrees clockwise from the object on the left, matching the transformation from the top section.

Thus, (C) is the correct visual transformation that matches the top example.",0,180
44,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

To arrive at the answer, let's analyze the left-to-right transformations on top of the puzzle and then apply this to the three options on the bottom.

The transformation on top shows a red mug with white patterns. From the left to the right, the mug is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This changes the orientation of the mug's handle from pointing to the left to pointing down.

Now, let's apply this understanding to the transformations on the bottom:

(A) The pig is rotated roughly 90 degrees from standing on all fours to lying on its back. This is not a rotation around the vertical axis like the mug but instead is a roll along the length of the pig's body.

(B) The pig is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around its vertical axis, which is similar to the rotation of the mug. The standing pig on the left changes orientation so that in the right image, the side that was originally facing the viewer is now facing right.

(C) The pig is rotated slightly less than 90 degrees counter-clockwise around its vertical axis. While it is a vertical axis rotation, it is in the opposite direction relative to the mug's rotation.

Considering the nature of the transformations, option (B) is the one that matches the same left-to-right transformation seen with the mug on top of the puzzle.",0,No change
44,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the transformation at the top of the puzzle. We see a mug on the left side that is upright and on the right side, the same mug is on its side, rotated 90 degrees to the right.

2. Now, we need to find the transformation on the bottom (A, B, or C) that matches this 90-degree rotation to the right.

3. Analyzing option (A): The pig is rotated, but the direction of the rotation is a flip rather than a 90-degree turn to the right. This does not match the top transformation.

4. Analyzing option (B): The pig is rotated 90 degrees to the right from the first to the second image, which matches the mug's top transformation.

5. Analyzing option (C): The pig is rotated but it looks like the rotation is 90 degrees to the left, which is the opposite direction of the mug's transformation on the top.

Option (B) is the correct match because it reflects the same kind of 90-degree rightward rotation as the transformation shown on the top of the puzzle.",0,180
44,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Look at the transformation of the object at the top of the image. The mug is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the upright position to lie on its side with the handle pointing up.

2. Now, let's compare this to the three sets of transformations at the bottom:

   - (A) shows a pig rotating from facing left in the first image to facing downwards in the second image. This is not the same as the mug's rotation.
   
   - (B) shows a pig rotating from facing left in the first image to lying on its side with its feet pointing up in the second image. This is analogous to the mug's handle pointing up after the rotation and matches the kind of rotation the mug went through.

   - (C) shows a pig rotating from facing left in the first image to facing upwards in the second image. This is also not the same as the mug's rotation.

3. Therefore, option (B) best represents the same type of rotation as the one observed in the mug's transformation â€“ a 90-degree clockwise rotation resulting in the object being on its side with the top part facing up.",0,No change
41,0,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, the object (which looks like a backpack) is rotated 90 degrees to the right (clockwise). You can tell because the side with the vertical zippers is facing up in the first image, and it's facing right in the second image.

2. Now let's examine the transformations at the bottom:
   - In option (A), the object (a bug) does not rotate correctly. The first and second images are the same; it's a translation, not a rotation.
   - In option (B), the bug rotates 90 degrees to the right (clockwise) just like the backpack transformation on top. The cap on the bug's back that is facing up in the first image is facing right in the second image.
   - In option (C), the bug rotates more than 90 degrees and additionally flips, which is not the same transformation as shown in the top example. 

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer, because it displays the same type of rotation as the object in the top sequence.",0,180
41,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

To solve the puzzle, let's perform a step-by-step analysis of the transformations:

1. Examine the top transformation: We see an object transforming from left to right by a 90-degree rotation in the clockwise direction. The red face is on the left side in the first image and ends up on the top in the second image.

2. Apply this transformation logic to the bottom options:
   - (A) The first image in the sequence shows the bug viewed from the side, and the second image also shows the bug from the side, but slightly tilted backward. This does not match the 90-degree rotation transformation from the top.
   - (B) The first image shows the bug viewed from the side, and the second image shows the bug from a top-down perspective. This indicates that the bug has undergone a 90-degree rotation in the clockwise direction, similar to the top transformation.
   - (C) The first image in this sequence shows the bug viewed from the side, and the second image shows the bug from the opposite side. This is more of a 180-degree rotation or a horizontal flip and does not match the top transformation of a 90-degree rotation.

Therefore, only (B) shows the same type of transformation as the one on the top of the puzzle, which is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.",0,180
41,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation that occurs in the top sequence and then apply the same logic to the options (A), (B), and (C).

Top Sequence:
- The object (a red backpack with green straps) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

Now let's apply the same rotation to the three sequences at the bottom:

(A) The object (an insect) is rotated but not in a consistent 90-degree clockwise rotation. The initial rotation is more than 90 degrees, and it does not resemble the top transformation.

(B) The object (the same insect) rotates 90 degrees clockwise from the first to the second image, aligning with the top transformation.

(C) The object rotates but not in the same way as the top sequence. The rotation appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise turn from the first to the second image, which is the inverse of the rotation seen in the top sequence.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it has a 90-degree clockwise rotation consistent with the top example.",0,No change
35,0,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (C).

Let's analyze the transformations step-by-step:

1. In the top transformation, the object (a plush shark) rotates by 90 degrees to the right, moving from a horizontal position to a vertical position, with its belly facing to the left.

2. Looking at transformations (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:
   - In (A), the bag rotates 90 degrees to the right from one image to the next, but not in the same axis as the shark does in the top transformation. The top of the bag faces left in the first image and up in the second.
   - In (B), the bag rotates 90 degrees, but it flips upside down rather than rotating to the right side.
   - In (C), the bag rotates 90 degrees to the right around a horizontal axis similar to the shark on the top. In the first image, the front of the bag is visible, and in the second image, its side is visible, with the top part of the bag facing left.

Option (C) matches the type of rotation seen in the top transformation, where the object rotates 90 degrees to the right, resulting in the belly of the shark (top image) and the top of the bag (bottom C option) facing the same direction (left) after the rotation.",1,-90
35,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top of the puzzle, we observe a shark plush toy that rotates 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

2. We now need to find the sequence among options (A), (B), and (C) that demonstrates the same 90-degree clockwise transformation.

3. Observing option (A), the lunch bag rotates but not in the correct direction; it is a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, which is the opposite of the shark's rotation.

4. In option (C), although the lunch bag rotates clockwise, the side with the zipper pull tab should be on top after a 90-degree clockwise rotation. However, it is on the side, indicating a 180-degree rotation instead.

5. Option (B) shows a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which matches the shark plush toy's transformation. The front side of the lunch bag that is facing up in the first image is facing right in the second image, which is consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Therefore, the correct answer that matches the transformation shown by the top object is (B).",0,No change
35,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation where a shark plush toy is rotated. It starts facing to the left and ends up rotated 90 degrees to face upwards after the transformation.

2. Now examine the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) and look for the same 90-degree rotational change:

   - (A) shows a lunch bag viewed from the front, then viewed from the side, but not rotated. This one does not match the rotation of the shark.
   
   - (B) shows a lunch bag starting from a frontal view and then rotated 90 degrees to show the top view. This matches the type of rotation seen with the shark plush toy.
   
   - (C) shows a lunch bag that appears to be the same view before and after, with no rotation, just a slight change in the positioning of the flap.

From this analysis, only (B) demonstrates the same left-to-right transformation of a 90-degree rotation as observed in the top example with the shark plush toy.",1,-90
30,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, we analyze the transformation of the object on top and then apply the same logic to the three sets of objects at the bottom to determine which one undergoes the identical transformation.

For the object on top, the transformation is as follows:
- The left image is the original position of the object.
- The right image is the object rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Now let's apply this rotation to the options at the bottom:
- Option (A) shows two identical images with no apparent rotation or change.
- Option (B) shows the flower rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which is the same transformation that the object on top underwent.
- Option (C) shows the flower rotated, and one leaf is removed.

Since we're looking for the same left-to-right transformation, which is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the correct answer is (B), because it shows the flower rotated 90 degrees clockwise without any other changes. Options (A) and (C) do not match the transformation shown on top.",1,-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a cheese grater being rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise from the left image to the right image.

2. Looking at the transformations at the bottom:

   - Option (B) shows a flower being rotated but not in a clear 90 degrees as the flower appears to hinge towards the viewer. It changes perspective in a way that is not consistent with a simple 90-degree rotation.

   - Option (C) shows two identical flowers without any transformation between the images.

3. Since only option (A) displays the same type of 90-degree counterclockwise rotation as the cheese grater example at the top, option (A) is the correct answer.",1,-90
