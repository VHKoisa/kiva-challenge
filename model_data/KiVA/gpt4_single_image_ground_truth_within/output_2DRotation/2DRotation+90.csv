To solve this visual puzzle, let's follow the transformation on the top and apply it to the bottom transformations:

1. **Top Transformation**: The red mug is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise (if viewed from the top) or turned onto its side. After the rotation, the handle of the mug is visible on the right side.

2. **Bottom Transformations**:
   - (A): The pig is rotated but not in the same manner as the mug. After the transformation, the pig is seen from a different perspective; however, it's not solely a 90-degree rotation onto its side.
   - (B): The pig undergoes a rotation that matches the top transformation. Initially standing, the pig is turned onto its side, mimicking a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
   - (C): The pig is rotated but seems to be rotated more than 90 degrees and not onto its side like the example with the mug.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct transformation that matches the top transformation, which is a 90-degree clockwise rotation onto the side.",0,180
44,1,0,90,0,90,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the top transformation of the mug: the mug is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

2. Now apply this transformation rule to the three options (A), (B), and (C) below:
   - (A) shows a pig that has been flipped horizontally. This is not a 90-degree rotation.
   - (B) shows a pig that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which matches the transformation shown at the top with the mug.
   - (C) also shows a pig that has been flipped, but this time vertically. It's not a 90-degree rotation either.

3. Therefore, the only option that undergoes the same 90-degree clockwise rotation as the mug at the top is (B).",0,180
44,2,0,90,0,90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the top transformation: The red mug on the top row is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

2. Compare to option (A): The pig is facing to the right and slightly towards the viewer in both pictures, with only a small change in the angle of view.

3. Compare to option (B): The pig is rotated 90 degrees from the left image to the right image, similarly to the red mug on the top.

4. Compare to option (C): The pig is rotated about 90 degrees but in a different axis, going from a side view to facing the viewer.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on top is (B), as it shows a 90-degree rotation similar to the transformation of the mug.",0,180

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to compare the transformation of the shark at the top with the transformations of the objects at the bottom, looking for a match in the 90-degree rotation pattern.

Looking at the shark at the top:
- In the left image, the shark is oriented with its belly facing down and its back facing up.
- In the right image, the shark has been rotated 90 degrees to the left, so that its belly is now facing left and its back is facing right.

Now let's examine the bottom transformations:
- Option (A) shows an object (a backpack with a sports-themed pattern) that when rotated from left to right, does not match the top pattern. The object rotates but not a complete 90-degree turn and it flips over to its front, which is not analogous to the shark's rotation.
- Option (B) shows an object that is rotated 90 degrees to the left from left to right, similar to the shark. Before the turn, the pocket faces up, and after the rotation, it faces left, just like the shark's belly goes from down to left.
- Option (C) displays an object that doesn't rotate fully 90 degrees—it seems to rotate more than 90 degrees and also flips over in the process, which is not in line with the top transformation.

Therefore, option (B) is the one that matches the transformation pattern of the shark from the top of the puzzle.",1,90
35,1,0,90,0,90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Let's analyze the top transformation of the shark first. The shark on the left has its head pointing to the top-left corner of the image and its belly is facing towards the right side of the image. After the transformation, the shark's head points directly to the right, and its belly is facing downward. This indicates a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees.

- Now, let's examine the bottom transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C):
    - For transformation (A), the bag on the left has the front face visible with the soccer ball at the upper left corner, and on the right, the bag is rotated so that the previous left side becomes the front face, with the soccer ball at the bottom right corner. This is not a simple 90-degree rotation; it is a different transformation.
    
    - For transformation (B), the bag on the left has the front face visible with the soccer ball at the upper left corner, just like in (A). After the transformation, the bag on the right shows the previous top of the bag as the new front face, with the soccer ball now in the bottom left corner. This matches the 90-degree clockwise rotation we observed in the shark transformation.
    
    - For transformation (C), the bag starts the same as in (A) and (B), but after the transformation, it is turned in such a way that the previous right side of the bag becomes the front",0,No change

To solve this puzzle, we need to compare the transformation that happens to the shark in the top pair of images with each of the three transformations happening to the objects in the bottom sets of images, which are marked as (A), (B), and (C).

Looking at the top transformation, the shark is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

Now, let's analyze the three transformations below:

- For set (A), the left image rotates 90 degrees clockwise to become the right image.
- For set (B), the left image does not simply rotate; it appears to have been flipped horizontally, changing the orientation of the patterns on the pouch.
- For set (C), the left image rotates 180 degrees to become the right image.

Since we're looking for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation, option (A) is the only one that matches the top transformation of the shark. Options (B) and (C) involve different transformations and do not match the example given at the top.",0,No change

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation of the object on top first and then apply the same logic to the transformations on the bottom.

Top Transformation:
- The left image features an elephant that is upright and facing to the left.
- The right image shows the same elephant rotated 90 degrees clockwise, now facing downwards.

Now let's apply this transformation logic to the options below:

(A) The left image shows a person standing with their feet to the left and their head pointing up.
- The right image in (A) is the person rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Now, their feet point downwards, and their head points to the right.
This matches the transformation we saw in the elephant above.

(B) In this pair, the left image has the person's feet pointing up and their head pointing to the left.
- The right image shows them rotated, but it's not a 90-degree clockwise rotation—it's actually a flip across the vertical axis because if it was a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the feet would point to the right, not left.

(C) The left image of this pair has the person's feet pointing up and their head pointing to the left, similar to (B).
- The right image shows them rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which can be inferred because their feet are now pointing to the right and their head is pointing downwards.

The correct answer, therefore, is (A) because it is the only transformation that matches the ",1,+90
19,1,0,90,0,90,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The transformation happening on the top of the puzzle with the elephant shows a 90-degree clockwise rotation. You can tell because the elephant's position changes from facing left to facing downwards.

- Now we need to compare this transformation with the three options provided (A), (B), and (C), which are transformations of a person on a snowboard.

- Option (A) shows a rotation that is also 90 degrees clockwise. The snowboarder goes from facing left to facing downwards, mirroring the rotation seen with the elephant.

- Option (B) does not match because the snowboarder seems to flip over to an upside-down position instead of merely rotating.

- Option (C) also does not match because the direction of the rotation is counter-clockwise, which is the opposite of what is shown in the transformation of the elephant.

Conclusively, only (A) has the same type of transformation as the one on the top of the puzzle, a 90-degree clockwise rotation.",1,+90

To solve the visual puzzle, let's look at the top transformation of the elephant and compare it with each of the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C).

1. For the transformation of the elephant, the direction of rotation is counterclockwise from the perspective of an observer on top, as the elephant rotates 90 degrees to the left side.

2. Looking at option (A), we see that the person in the image rotates in the same manner as the elephant - the person's orientation changes by 90 degrees counterclockwise from a top-down viewpoint.

3. For option (B), the person seems to rotate not around their vertical axis, but rather around a horizontal axis, showing a change from standing upright to lying on their back.

4. In option (C), the person rotates clockwise by 90 degrees from a top-down viewpoint, which is the opposite direction to that of the elephant's transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it is the only option where the person undergoes a similar 90-degree counterclockwise rotation from the top perspective, just like the elephant in the top example.",0,No change

To solve this puzzle, we look at the transformation from the left to the right in each sequence:

Top sequence:
The bicycle undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation from left to right.

Bottom sequences:
- (A) The object doesn't appear to rotate at all; it stays in the same orientation.
- (B) The object has undergone a flip rather than a rotation.
- (C) The object has undergone a 90-degree clockwise rotation from left to right, similar to the bicycle on top.

The correct transformation that matches the top sequence is (C), as it is the only one where the object has rotated 90 degrees clockwise.",0,180

Let's break down the transformation seen in the top set of images:

- The transformation of the object (the bicycle) involves a rotation by 90 degrees.

Now examining the bottom three sets of transformations:

- Option (A) shows a chicken with no clear rotation between the two images; instead, there is a change in angle or perspective but not a definitive rotation.
- Option (B) shows a chicken being rotated, but this rotation is more than 90 degrees and includes a flip, changing the perspective to a back view.
- Option (C) shows a rotation of 90 degrees, similar to the top image. The left image has the front of the chicken facing to the left and on the floor, and the right image has the front of the chicken facing downwards with the top of its head touching the floor and its legs up in the air. 

Therefore, option (C) matches the 90-degree rotation transformation on the top of the puzzle, which meets the criteria of the puzzle's transformation.",1,+90

To solve this puzzle, let's examine the transformation applied to the bicycle at the top of the image:

1. The left image shows a bicycle in a normal orientation.
2. The right image shows the same bicycle rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

Now, let's analyze the transformations of the object at the bottom of the image (which appears to be a teapot):

(A) The teapot in the left image is oriented with its spout pointing to the left. In the right image, the teapot has been rotated such that the spout is facing upward. This is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which matches the transformation applied to the bicycle.

(B) The teapot in the left image is upright with its spout pointing to the left. In the right image, the teapot is upside down with the spout pointing to the right. This is not a 90-degree clockwise rotation; it looks like a 180-degree rotation.

(C) The teapot in the left image is upright with its spout pointing to the left. In the right image, the teapot is lying on its side with its spout pointing upward. While this also involves turning the spout upward, the entire teapot is on its side, which differs from the orientation seen in option (A) and does not match a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Therefore, the only transformation that matches the example of the bicycle is option (A), where the teapot is rotated ",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a lion. The transformation involves the lion rotating 90 degrees to the right, as we can tell by the position of the head and limbs in the before and after images.

2. Now looking at the three sets of transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:

   - For (A), the guitar rotates 90 degrees to the right. The headstock of the guitar, which is originally pointing up, is pointing to the right in the transformed image.
   
   - For (B), the guitar does not simply rotate; it flips to show the backside of the guitar. This is a different transformation than what we see with the lion on top since no rotation is involved.
   
   - For (C), the guitar in the first image is shown to rotate, but it rotates 90 degrees to the left, not to the right, as indicated by the headstock pointing down in the second image.

3. The only transformation that matches the top is (A), where the object rotates 90 degrees to the right without flipping or rotating to the left.",0,180
21,1,0,90,0,90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examine the transformation of the lion on top: the lion rotates 90 degrees to the right from the left image to the right image. The lion's orientation changes in such a way that its head, initially on top in the first image, becomes on the right side in the second image.

2. Now apply this rule to the transformations at the bottom:

   - In image (A), the guitar rotates, but it appears to move away from the viewer, with the body of the guitar getting smaller, which doesn't match the lion's rotation on top.

   - In image (B), the guitar is flipped and rotated 90 degrees clockwise, similar to the lion's transformation. The head of the guitar, initially on the left, moves to the bottom position, which aligns with a 90 degrees rightward rotation.

   - In image (C), the guitar is merely duplicated with a slight offset, and there's no rotation comparable to the lion's rotation.

The option that matches the rotation sequence demonstrated by the lion on top is thus (B).",0,180
21,2,0,+90,0,90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the top puzzle, the lion on the left is standing on all fours. In the right image, the lion has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, so it appears to be on its back with its paws in the air.
2. Option (A) shows a guitar that starts upright and then appears to lay flat with the neck pointing towards us, which represents a fall forward, not a 90-degree rotation.
3. Option (B) shows the guitar in an upright position and then in the second image rotated 90 degrees clockwise, with the body of the guitar closest to us and the neck pointing right, similar to how the lion ends up on its back with its feet to the right.
4. Option (C) shows a guitar that starts in a standing position upright and then appears in the second image also upright without a visible transformation.

Therefore, (B) correctly represents the same type of transformation as the one seen with the lion on top of the puzzle.",1,+90
