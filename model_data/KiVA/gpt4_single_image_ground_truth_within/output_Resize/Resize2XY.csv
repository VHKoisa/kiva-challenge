26,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (C).

To determine the correct answer, let's examine the transformation taking place from the left to the right in the top example with the bicycle:

1. The bicycle image on the left is smaller in size.
2. The bicycle image on the right is larger in size.

The transformation is simply an increase in size.

Now let's analyze each of the bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C):

- In (A), the ball increases in size and changes texture, from smooth to having lines.
- In (B), the ball remains the same size but duplicates. There is no size increase.
- In (C), the ball increases in size from left to right.

Out of the three, only (C) shows a single ball that increases in size, mirroring the transformation of the bicycle at the top of the puzzle, from smaller to larger without any other changes, like texture alteration or duplication.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",0,0.5XY
26,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation shown at the top of the puzzle features a bicycle that increases in size from the left image to the right image. There are no changes in color, texture, or additional effects applied to the bicycle apart from the change in scale.

2. Now let's examine each of the options at the bottom of the puzzle:
   - Option (A): The object (a sphere) on the left is larger and becomes smaller on the right. This is opposite to the transformation of the bicycle, which increases in size.
   - Option (B): The size of the object (a sphere) remains consistent between the left and right images; there is no change in scale.
   - Option (C): The object (a sphere) on the left is smaller and becomes larger on the right. This matches the transformation of the bicycle from smaller to larger.

3. Therefore, the transformation in option (C) matches the transformation at the top, which is an increase in size without any other changes.",1,2XY
26,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, the object (a bicycle) increases in size from the left image to the right image.

2. Looking at the three transformations at the bottom:

   - (A) shows an object (a sphere) that enlarges from the left image to the right image, similar to the bicycle transformation above.
   - (B) shows an object (a sphere) that reduces in size from the left image to the right image, which is the opposite of the top transformation.
   - (C) shows an object (a sphere) that maintains the same size in both the left and right images, showing no changes in size, and thus does not match the top transformation.

3. Therefore, the transformation in (A) matches the type of transformation seen in the top images, where the object increases in size from left to right.",1,2XY
37,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top involves an object (an Android mascot) that starts smaller on the left and becomes larger on the right while keeping the same proportions and characteristics.

2. Now we have to find a transformation at the bottom that follows the same pattern.

3. Looking at the options:
   - (A) shows an object that starts larger on the left and becomes smaller on the right, which is the opposite of the transformation on the top.
   - (B) shows an object that starts smaller on the left and becomes larger on the right, mirroring the transformation on the top.
   - (C) shows an object that does get larger from left to right but changes its shape by elongating, which is different from the top transformation where shape/proportions are consistent. 

4. Since (B) is the only one where the object gets uniformly larger without changing shape, it matches the transformation we're looking for.",0,No change
37,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(A)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object in the top row and compare it to the transformations in the bottom row:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we have an image of an object on the left that becomes larger in the image on the right. There is no change in proportion or orientation; the object simply increases in size.

2. Now, let's look at the bottom row:
   - Transformation (A) shows an object that increases in size from the left image to the right image. This matches the type of transformation we see in the top part of the puzzle.
   - Transformation (B) shows an object that remains the same size but is duplicated in the second image. This does not match the single enlargement transformation seen at the top.
   - Transformation (C) shows an object that does not significantly change in size but instead reduces in size from the first to the second image, which again does not match the transformation seen at the top.

Therefore, the transformation in (A) on the bottom row is consistent with the transformation on the top of the puzzle, showing a simple increase in size without any other changes.",1,2XY
37,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top shows an object (which resembles the Android robot logo) increasing in size from the left image to the right.

2. Now we examine the transformations at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C) to see which one matches the transformation witnessed at the top. 

3. Option (A) shows a cup that increases in size from the left image to the right, which matches the type of transformation we see at the top.

4. Option (B) presents a somewhat inconsistent transformation; the cup on the left is larger than the first, but then it becomes smaller again in the right image. This does not match the single increasing size transformation at the top.

5. Option (C) also does not match the transformation at the top because it shows a cup that is consistent in size in the first two images and then decreases in size in the final right image.

6. Therefore, since we are looking for a simple increase in the size from left to right without any decrease, the correct answer is (A).",1,2XY
45,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (A).

The transformation occurring at the top of the puzzle shows a simple toy car on the left that increases in size and complexity to become a more detailed toy truck on the right. This transformation involves both an increase in size and complexity/detail of the object.

Looking at the options below, let's analyze them step by step:

- Option (A) shows a small simple toy monkey on the left and a larger, more detailed toy monkey on the right. This matches the transformation at the top, where size and complexity increase.
- Option (B) shows a moderately detailed monkey that remains the same in size and detail level from left to right. 
- Option (C) shows a monkey that gets smaller from left to right, which is the opposite of the desired transformation.

Thus, the transformation that matches the top one is (A), where there is an increase in size and complexity from left to right.",1,2XY
45,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (B).

To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the top transformation step by step:
1. We observe a small red and yellow vehicle on the left that transforms into a larger red and yellow truck on the right.
2. The transformation involves an increase in size while keeping the color scheme mostly consistent, with the addition of details.

Now let's apply the same principles to the bottom transformations:

(A) Shows a small, simple monkey figure on the left that becomes a larger, more detailed monkey figure on the right. The size increases, and details are added, but this transformation also changes the color of the monkey from a light brown to a darker brown, which is not consistent with the top transformation.

(B) Shows a small monkey figure on the left that becomes a larger monkey figure on the right. The size increases while the color scheme remains consistent, and there's a slight addition of details, similar to the top transformation.

(C) Shows a small monkey figure on the left that becomes an even smaller monkey figure on the right. This transformation involves a decrease in size, which is the opposite of the top transformation.

Therefore, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation in terms of the size increase and consistent color scheme is (B).",0,No change
45,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(A)

To solve this visual puzzle, we first analyze the transformation at the top, which depicts a vehicle:

1. The left image shows a smaller vehicle with simplistic detailing.
2. The right image shows a larger, more complex version of the vehicle with additional details such as a truck bed and a cabin.

With this pattern in mind, let's examine the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle:

- Option (A) shows a small, simple version of a monkey on the left and a larger, more detailed monkey on the right. This matches the pattern observed at the top, where the object increases in size and detail.
- Option (B) shows a larger monkey on the left, but the right image is of a smaller monkey. This does not match the pattern, as it shows a decrease in size rather than an increase.
- Option (C) shows identical monkeys that are the same size and detail level, so there is no transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) since it follows the transformation pattern of increasing in size and detail as seen with the vehicle at the top.",1,2XY
2,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation shown at the top of the puzzle, we can see that a small shop stand grows larger from the left image to the right image. The sign on top of the shop also changes from a flat appearance to one with a fringed border and the word ""SHOP"" written on it. There's a comprehensive change in size and some additional details.

2. Now let's examine the transformations at the bottom:

   - In (A), the figure shrinks, which is the opposite of the top transformation where the object grows larger.
   - In (B), the figure remains the same size but changes its features slightly; its shirt changes color, indicating a transformation akin to the additional detailing on the shop's sign in the top transformation.
   - In (C), the figure not only grows but also rotates and changes the position of its limbs. There's an increase in size like the shop, but the rotation and change in position does not match the addition of details seen in the top transformation.

3. Because (B) most closely matches the top transformation through changes in detail without a change in size, rotation, or position, (B) is the correct answer. The shop transformation involves both a change in size and an addition of visible elements (i.e., the sign's design), but within the given options, (B) is the only one that includes any sort of change in detail, thus making it",0,No change
2,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we observe that the object on the left (a small ""SHOP"" sign) becomes bigger on the right. This increase in size appears to be the primary transformation characteristic.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a person that shrinks from left to right, which is the opposite of the enlargement seen in the top transformation.
   - (B) shows a person that remains unchanged in size from left to right. There is no visible transformation, making it the best match for the top transformation, wherein the characteristic change we're focusing on is size only—no other changes are evident.
   - (C) shows a person that changes in size and rotation from left to right, which adds an additional transformation not observed in the top transformation.

3. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer, as it is the only option where the size of the person remains unchanged, and only the surrounding frame of the images changes size, which is consistent with the top transformation where only the size of the object changes while the object itself remains the same.",0,No change
2,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (C).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- On the top of the puzzle, we see a small ""SHOP"" object that becomes larger in the image on the right. There is a clear increase in size from the left to the right image.

Now, we look at the bottom three transformations:

- In (A), the figure on the left appears to be larger than the figure on the right, which represents a decrease in size and is the opposite of the top transformation. Therefore, (A) is not correct.
  
- In (B), both figures appear to be the same size, which means there is no change in size from left to right. Therefore, (B) is not correct.

- In (C), the figure on the left is smaller than the figure on the right, which is an increase in size, matching the top transformation where the object also increases in size.

Given that we are looking for the transformation that matches the top one, where the object increases in size from left to right, (C) is the only one that does this and is therefore the correct answer.",1,2XY
44,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. The top transformation shows an object (which appears to be a cartoon character) increasing in size from left to right.

2. Looking at the three transformations on the bottom, we need to identify which transformation also shows an increase in size from left to right.

    - (A) shows two objects that are the same size, so there is no change in size.
    - (B) shows an object that increases in size from left to right, similar to the top transformation.
    - (C) shows an object that decreases in size from left to right, which is the opposite of the top transformation.

3. Therefore, the only transformation that matches the top transformation in terms of the object increasing in size from left to right is (B).",1,2XY
44,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We examine the top transformation. Here, we see a small round object on the left that increases significantly in size on the right. There are no changes aside from the size increase.

2. Now, we look at each bottom transformation:
   - (A) shows a wine glass that increases in size from left to right, similar to the top transformation.
   - (B) shows a wine glass that also increases in size from left to right but maintains the same proportions – this closely matches the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a wine glass that not only increases in size from left to right but also changes its proportions, becoming much narrower in relation to its height. This is different from the uniform scaling in the top transformation.

3. The transformation that best matches the top transformation in terms of consistent, uniform scaling without changing the object's proportions is (B). The wine glasses in option (B) increase in size from the first image to the next in a similar way to the round object on the top of the puzzle.",0,No change
44,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(A)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze each transformation step by step:

1. Look at the top transformation: The object on the left, which appears to be a bug or a small creature, increases in size to become the larger bug on the right.

2. Now, let's examine each of the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) to find a similar change.

   - In option (A), the wine glass on the left increases in size to become the larger wine glass on the right. This matches the transformation pattern observed on the top, wherein size is the only changing factor.
   - Option (B) shows a wine glass shrinking in size from left to right, which is the opposite of the transformation on the top.
   - Option (C) demonstrates replication, where the wine glass is duplicated rather than changing in size.

3. Since transformation (A) is the only one where the object increases in size from left to right like the transformation on the top, it is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is (A).",1,2XY
