17,0,5,4,5,4,"The correct answer to this visual puzzle is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, there is a sequence of dogs. On the left side of the top transformation, there are five dogs, and on the right side, there are four dogs. This indicates that one dog is missing from the left to the right side, so the transformation involves a decrease by 1.

2. Now, examining the transformations on the bottom labeled (A), (B), and (C):
   - (A) shows 7 leaves on the left and 8 leaves on the right, which indicates an increase by 1 instead of a decrease.
   - (B) shows 7 leaves on the left and 6 leaves on the right, which is a decrease by 1, matching the top transformation's sequence.
   - (C) shows 8 leaves on both the left and the right, indicating no change in the number of leaves.

Only transformation (B) matches the decrease by 1 pattern demonstrated in the top transformation. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",0,1

To solve this visual puzzle, let's first examine the transformation happening on the top part of the puzzle. We can see that there is a sequence of goats. On the left, there are five goats, and on the right, there are four goats. This indicates that one goat has been subtracted from the sequence.

Now, let's check the three options at the bottom marked as (A), (B), and (C):

- In (A), the left side shows seven objects and the right side shows six. This matches the top transformation, where one object is subtracted.
- In (B), both the left and the right side show seven objects, so there is no subtraction of objects here.
- In (C), the left side shows six objects and the right side shows five, also indicating a subtraction of one object.

While both (A) and (C) show a subtraction of one object, (A) is the correct answer since it represents a closer initial quantity (seven to six) in comparison to the top sequence, as opposed to the bottom sequence in (C) which starts with a lesser quantity (six to five). 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",0,No change
17,2,5,4,5,4,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The transformation on the top shows a sequence of five goats reducing by one to become four goats.
2. We need to find a similar transformation among the options (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom where the object decreases by one in quantity from left to right.
3. Option (A) shows eight objects that decrease by one to become seven objects.
4. Option (B) shows nine objects in both the left and right pictures, so there is no decrease in quantity.
5. Option (C) shows seven objects in both the left and right pictures, so there is no decrease in quantity either.
6. Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top is option (A), where the number of objects decreases by one from left to right.",1,-1

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The transformation at the top depicts a sequence where the number of balloons decreases by one.
2. We need to find a similar pattern of decrease by one in the three choices given at the bottom.

Looking at each option:
- (A) shows two panels with four keyhole balloons each, indicating no change in quantity from left to right.
- (B) also shows two panels with identical numbers of keyhole balloons, four in each panel, also indicating no change.
- (C) presents a panel with five keyhole balloons on the left and a panel with four keyhole balloons on the right, which matches the decrease by one pattern shown in the top transformation.

Therefore, the transformation in (C) is analogous to the transformation at the top, where the number decreases by one.",1,-1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we start with 4 balloons and end with 3 balloons. The transformation here is a reduction of one balloon.

2. Now looking at the transformations on the bottom:

   - Option (A) starts with 4 keys and ends with 3 keys, showing a reduction of one key.
   - Option (B) starts with 3 keys and still has 3 keys, showing no change.
   - Option (C) starts with 2 keys and also ends with 2 keys, showing no change.

3. The correct transformation that matches the top example is the one that also has a reduction by one from the left picture to the right picture, which is option (A).",0,No change
0,2,3,2,3,2,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top shows a sequence of balloons where the number of balloons decreases by one from the left picture to the right picture.
2. In the left picture, there are four balloons. In the right picture, there are three balloons. This establishes the pattern: a decrease by one element from left to right.
3. Option (A) shows a sequence of picture frames with five keys hanging on the left and four keys hanging on the right. This matches the pattern of decreasing by one.
4. Options (B) and (C) do not match the pattern. In (B), the number of keys remains the same, and in (C), two keys are removed instead of one.
5. Therefore, the transformation that is the same as the top transformation is (A), as it follows the rule of decreasing the number of items by one from left to right.",0,No change

To solve the visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation taking place:

On the top of the puzzle, we have a sequence of six cats on the left, and on the right side, there are five cats. This shows the transformation that one cat has been removed from the sequence, resulting in a decrease by 1.

Now let's analyze the three options below:

(A) There are six drums on the left, but only four on the right, which means that two drums have been removed, not one. Therefore, this does not match the transformation at the top.

(B) There are five drums on the left and four on the right. This means that one drum has been removed, which directly mirrors the transformation of the cats at the top.

(C) There are five drums on the left and five on the right, with no change in quantity, which does not match the transformation at the top.

Since we are looking for the object transformation that decreases by 1, only option (B) fits the criterion, making it the correct answer.",1,-1

To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the transformation that occurs from the left to the right image within each pair.

Starting with the top transformation, we see five images of what appears to be squirrels on the left, and on the right side, there are four. This indicates that the transformation involves reducing the number of items by one.

Now we look at the transformations on the bottom:

- Option (A): There are six drums on the left and five on the right. This matches the transformation we saw at the top, where the number was reduced by one.
- Option (B): There are also six drums on the left, but on the right side, there are still six, with one of them being broken. The number has not been reduced, so this does not match the transformation at the top.
- Option (C): There are six drums on the left and six on the right, with no evident changes. This means the quantity remains the same, which does not align with the transformation at the top where there should be a reduction by one.

Thus, option (A) is the correct transformation, which reflects the same change as the transformation at the top of the puzzle: a decrease in the number of objects by one.",0,No change
18,2,4,3,4,3,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top part of the puzzle, we see the transformation of a group of cats into one fewer cat. Specifically, there are five cats on the left, and four cats on the right, so one cat has been removed.

2. We will now look at the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom part of the puzzle, to see which one matches the same pattern of decreasing by one.

3. In transformation (A), there are six drums on the left and five drums on the right. This shows that one drum has been removed, exactly matching the pattern of the transformation at the top of the puzzle.

4. Option (B) shows a transformation in which only the color of one drum changes, but the count remains the same, so it does not match the pattern we are looking for.

5. Option (C) shows the same number of drums on both the left and the right, with no decrease in count. This does not match the pattern of the top transformation either.

Therefore, the correct answer to the puzzle is (A), as it is the transformation where the object decreases by one, just like the transformation on the top with the cats.",1,-1
11,0,4,3,4,3,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation at the top, you start with four images of an animal (which appears to be a type of bird) and end up with three. This means one animal is subtracted from the group, going from four to three.

2. Looking at the three transformations at the bottom:

   - (A) shows five dice on the left and five dice on the right, which means there is no subtraction.
   - (B) shows six dice on the left and five dice on the right, which indicates that one die has been subtracted.
   - (C) shows four dice on the left and four dice on the right, again showing no subtraction.

3. Since we're looking for a transformation that shows a subtraction of one, we disregard (A) and (C) as they do not show any subtraction.

4. (B) correctly shows a transformation where one piece is subtracted from the left image to the right image, matching the pattern we are looking for from the example above.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B), because it is the only option that shows a decrease by one, just like the animal images above.",0,+1
11,1,4,3,4,3,"The correct answer is (C).

Let's analyze the visual puzzle step-by-step:

1. Looking at the top of the puzzle, there is a transformation from five animals on the left side to four animals on the right side. This indicates that one animal has been removed from the series.

2. Now let's examine the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle to find a similar pattern:
   - Option (A) has four dice on the left and four dice on the right, with no change in the number of dice.
   - Option (B) has six dice on the left and six dice on the right, with no change in the number of dice.
   - Option (C) has five dice on the left and four dice on the right, which shows a decrease by one die, similar to the transformation at the top of the puzzle.

3. Since the transformation in option (C) also shows a decrease by one, this matches the same pattern as the transformation at the top with the animals.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",0,+1
11,2,4,3,4,3,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- At the top of the puzzle, we have a left-to-right transformation showing a group of four deer on the left that becomes a group of three deer on the right. This indicates a decrease by one deer.

- Each of the transformations at the bottom (A), (B), and (C) shows a set of six-sided dice with red pips.

- Option (A) has five dice with five pips each on both sides, indicating no change in the total number of pips or dice.

- Option (B) shows five dice with five pips each on the left side and four dice with five pips each on the right side. This indicates a decrease by one die, matching the pattern observed at the top with the deer.

- Option (C) has five dice with five pips each on the left and five dice on the right, but one die with a different number of pips (four instead of five), which does not match the criterion we're looking for. It shows a change in the number of pips on one die, not a decrease by one die.

Therefore, the correct answer that matches the top transformation is (B), where the quantity decreases by one unit from left to right.",1,-1

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

The top transformation of the puzzle shows three cookies on the left dropping to two cookies on the right, meaning one cookie has been removed or subtracted in the transformation.

We are looking for a bottom transformation that matches this ""decrease by 1"" pattern.

Option (A) shows no change between the left and right images; the number of circles remains four.

Option (B) shows a decrease in the number of circles; the left image has four circles and the right image has three circles. This reflects the same transformation on the top - a decrease by one.

Option (C) shows an increase in the number of circles; the left image has five circles and the right image has six circles.

Therefore, option (B) is the transformation that matches the ""decrease by 1"" pattern found in the top transformation of the puzzle.",1,-1

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation that occurs in the top row and then apply that rule to determine which of the transformations labeled (A), (B), or (C) is the same.

Top Row Transformation:
- The transformation from the left to the right picture involves the decrease of the number of cookies by one. The left picture shows three cookies, and the right picture shows two cookies.

Now let's look at the transformations in the bottom row:

(A) This transformation begins with four dots in the left box and ends with three dots in the right box, which means that one dot has been removed from left to right. This matches the rule observed in the top transformation: a decrease by one.

(B) This transformation shows a change from four dots to two dots, which is a decrease by two, not one.

(C) This transformation does not involve any decrease at all; there are four dots in both the left and the right box.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it is the only transformation that follows the same rule as the transformation in the top row – a decrease by one.",0,+1
22,2,3,2,3,2,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we observe three cookies on the left and two cookies on the right. This indicates that the transformation involves removing one cookie from left to right.

2. Now we examine the bottom three transformations (A), (B), and (C) to find which one matches the transformation rule established by the top part of the puzzle.

3. In option (A), we see four dots on the left and three dots on the right, which means one dot has been removed from left to right. This matches the transformation rule of decreasing by 1.

4. In option (B), there are five dots on the left and four dots on the right, also indicating the removal of one dot from left to right. This also matches the transformation rule of decreasing by 1.

5. In option (C), we see three dots on the left and three dots on the right, meaning there is no change in the number of dots, which does not correspond to the rule of decreasing by 1.

6. Since both options (A) and (B) match the transformation rule of decreasing by 1, but we have to select only one answer, we need to look carefully for another possible differentiator in the rules provided by the example. On closer examination, we notice that the top transformation shows the cookies arranged in a straight horizontal line, both in the left and right images. This pattern matches",0,+1
