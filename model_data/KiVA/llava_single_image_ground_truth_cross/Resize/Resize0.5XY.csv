The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves the size of objects becoming smaller. This is evident from the image of the frog on the left, which is larger than the frog on the right. The frog on the left is occupying a larger portion of the image, while the frog on the right is smaller and positioned in a smaller area. This indicates that the objects are transforming in size from left to right, which aligns with rule (1).</s>",1,Objects become smaller

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves the size of objects becoming smaller. This is evident from the image of the toy duck on the left, which is larger than the toy duck on the right. The transformation from the left to the right involves a reduction in size, which is consistent with rule (1).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The image on the left shows a toy duck that is larger than the toy duck on the right.
2. The toy duck on the right is smaller than the one on the left.
3. The transformation from the left to the right involves a reduction in size, which is consistent with rule (1).</s>",1,Objects become smaller

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves the size of objects becoming smaller. This is evident from the image of the toy duck on the left, which is larger than the toy duck on the right. The transformation of the toy duck from the left to the right is a visual representation of the object becoming smaller.

In the bottom of the puzzle, the left-to-right transformation involves the size of objects becoming smaller as well. The image of the toy car on the left is larger than the toy car on the right, and the image of the toy car on the right is smaller than the toy car on the left. This transformation is a visual representation of the object becoming smaller.

Therefore, the correct rule number is (1) Objects become smaller.</s>",1,Objects become smaller

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves the size of objects becoming smaller. In the top image, there is a bottle on the left side and a bottle on the right side. The bottle on the left is larger than the bottle on the right, indicating that the objects are becoming smaller as they move from left to right.

In the bottom of the puzzle, there are three left-to-right transformations of a different object. The object on the left is larger than the object in the middle, and the object in the middle is larger than the object on the right. This pattern of objects becoming smaller as they move from left to right is consistent with the rule (1) Objects become smaller.</s>",1,Objects become smaller
