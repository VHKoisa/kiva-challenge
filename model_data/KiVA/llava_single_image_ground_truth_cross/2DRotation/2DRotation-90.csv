37,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves the picture on the left transforming to the picture on the right. This transformation can be described as a 180-degree rotation, as the objects in the images are flipped horizontally. The puzzle features a snowman and a giraffe, and the transformation involves flipping the snowman and the giraffe horizontally.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left image, the snowman is facing left, and the giraffe is facing right.
2. In the right image, the snowman is facing right, and the giraffe is facing left.
3. The transformation involves flipping the snowman and the giraffe horizontally, resulting in the snowman facing right and the giraffe facing left.

This transformation is a 180-degree rotation, as the objects in the images are flipped horizontally.</s>",0,Objects rotate by 180 degrees
