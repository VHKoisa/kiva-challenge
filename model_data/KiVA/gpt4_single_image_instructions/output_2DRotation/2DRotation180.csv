Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Analyzing the transformation on top of the puzzle, we see a dog in two different states.
2. The color and size of the dog remain the same in both images, indicating that rules (1) and (3) do not apply.
3. The number of dogs is the same in both images, so rule (3) does not apply.
4. There is a clear change between the pictures; the dog is not in the same position, hence rule (4) does not apply.
5. The dog is not randomly transformed or altered in a way that would suggest rule (5) doesn't apply.

The change that occurs is in the orientation of the dog. In the left image, the dog is standing on all four legs, looking to the side. In the right image, the dog is flipped upside down, with its legs in the air. This indicates that the rule best describing the transformation is related to the dog's orientation.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Identify a Reference Point**: First, we need to find a part of the dog that we can use as a reference point to determine its orientation. The dog's head or the direction its belly is facing would be suitable reference points.

2. **Initial Position**: In the left image, the dog is standing upright on its legs, with its belly facing downwards and its head oriented to the side.

3. **Final Position**: In the right image, the dog's orientation is inverted relative to the first image, with its belly facing upwards and its head pointing in the opposite side direction.

4. **Determine the Angle of Rotation**: The reference point (belly or head) has moved to the position directly opposite to its initial position, which indicates that it has been rotated halfway around its axis.

5. **Consider Direction**: The direction of rotation is not specified, but the dog is upside-down in the right image compared to the left image.

6. **Count Quarter Turns**: If we consider the movement of the reference point from its original downward-facing position to its new upward-facing position, this would represent two quarter turns (90 degrees each), which totals 180 degrees.

Since the dog rotates from standing normally to being upside-down without any other transformation (such as a color change, number of objects change, etc.), the rule that best describes the top transformation in the puzzle is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Understand the Top Transformation**: We previously determined that the transformation on top involves the dog rotating by 180 degrees from standing on its legs to being completely inverted with its belly facing upwards.

2. **Analyze Bottom Transformations Separately**:
   - For (A), the left-to-right transition shows the submarine-like object rotating slightly around its longitudinal axis, but not flipping over.
   - For (B), there's a similar slight rotation around the longitudinal axis without flipping.
   - For (C), there is a distinct rotation where the object flips over by 180 degrees, similar to the dog on top. Initially, the object's top side is facing upwards, and in the right image, the same side is now facing downwards.

3. **Compare Changes**: Comparing the bottom transformations to the top transformation, we are looking for a 180-degree flip or rotation.

4. **Check for Matching Characteristics**: Transformation (C) matches the 180-degree flip seen in the top transformation, as the object is inverted in orientation, which is the same type of change experienced by the dog on top.

Based on these observations, the transformation at the bottom of the puzzle that is the same as the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is (C).",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the transformation on top of the puzzle, the object depicted is a desk fan.
- In the left image, the fan is faced upwards, with the front of the fan pointing to the top of the image.
- In the right image, the fan is facing downwards, with the front of the fan pointing to the bottom of the image.
- The object itself does not change in size, color, or number—only its orientation changes from pointing up to pointing down.
- This transformation demonstrates a change in the orientation of the object from one image to the next.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- First, I identify a distinct feature on the desk fan to track its rotation. In this case, the control panel on the base of the fan is a good reference point.
- Next, I visualize reference axes running through the control panel to determine the alignment of this feature before and after the rotation.
- In the left image, the control panel is facing upwards, with the buttons visible and aligned along the vertical axis.
- In the right image, the control panel is now facing downwards, still aligned with the vertical axis but on the opposite end, indicating that the top has moved to the bottom.
- There is no change in the feature's left-to-right positioning, just an inversion, which is characteristic of a 180-degree rotation.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that the object rotates by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top transformation shows the fan rotating by 180 degrees from the starting position to the ending position, changing its orientation from facing upwards to facing downwards.
- Now, I will examine each pair at the bottom:

  A) The fries in the left image are upright, and in the right image, they are still upright. There is no change in orientation; hence, it is not a match to the top transformation.

  B) The fries in the left image are upright, and in the right image, they are lying on their side. This indicates a rotation, but it's less than 180 degrees (likely a 90-degree rotation), which does not match the 180-degree rotation on the top.

  C) The fries in the left image are upright, and in the right image, they are upside down, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation. This matches the type and degree of rotation observed in the top transformation.

- None of the transformations change color, size, or number of the fries; therefore, the only variable we are assessing is rotation.
- Based on this analysis, option (C) exhibits the same 180-degree rotation as the transformation at the top of the puzzle and is thus the correct match.",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Upon observing the top transformation of the horse on a rocking base, we note that there is no change in the number of objects between the two images, so rule (1) does not apply.

2. The color of the horse and the base remains the same in both images, hence rule (2) does not apply.

3. The horse has undergone a change in orientation from upright to upside down, which falls under rule (3) that discusses the orientation of objects.

4. Since there is an observable change, rule (4) indicating no change between pictures does not apply.

5. A change has indeed occurred, so rule (5), suggesting none of the rules apply, is not appropriate.

Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects, represented by rule (3).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify reference points**: In the images of the horse on a rocking base, we can use features such as the horse's head or its legs as reference points.

2. **Examine starting position**: In the left image, the horse is upright, and its legs are positioned below the body, while the head is at the top.

3. **Look for orientation change**: In the right image, the horse is upside-down, which indicates that the reference points, such as the legs and head, are now in the opposite position—legs above the body and the head below.

4. **90-degree rotation check**: The horse has not rotated to a position where the reference points are adjacent to their starting position. It does not appear to have rotated to the side, which would indicate a 90-degree rotation.

5. **180-degree rotation check**: The reference points (head and legs) have moved to a position directly opposite their starting point—the head is now at the bottom and the legs at the top, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.

6. **Verify with other points**: If we check other features like the tail and the rocking base, they also confirm a 180-degree flip. The base was initially at the bottom and now is at the top, further indicating a 180-degree rotation.

7. **Rule confirmation**: Since the horse rotated in such a way that its orientation is inverted rather than being merely rotated to the side, the movement is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.

By following these steps, we can confirm that the transformation displayed at the top of the puzzle is best described by an object rotating by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the top transformation**:
   - From previous analysis, we know the horse on the top transformation rotates 180 degrees from left to right.

2. **Identify transformation features**:
   - The top transformation does not involve any other changes except the 180-degree rotation (no change in size, number, or color).

3. **Compare with the bottom transformations**:
   - Observe first transformation option (A): There's no visible rotation or flipping; the objects remain the same from left to right.
   - Observe second transformation option (B): The object is rotated, but the rotation appears less than 180 degrees; it looks more like a 90-degree rotation.
   - Observe third transformation option (C): The object is turned upside down, which indicates a 180-degree rotation, similar to the top transformation.

4. **Check for matching patterns**:
   - Option (A) does not match because there's no rotation.
   - Option (B) does not match because the degree of rotation is not the same (90 degrees instead of 180).
   - Option (C) matches the 180-degree rotation observed in the top transformation: The reference point (the creature's face) moves from facing up to facing down, just like the horse's orientation change.

5. **Rule out non-matching transformations**:
   - We can rule out options (A) and (B) as they do not feature the same transformation as the top puzzle.

6. **Confirm the match**:
   - Confirm that option (C) displays the same 180-degree rotation seen in the top transformation without any other changes to size, number, or color.

Therefore, the correct answer is that transformation (C) is the same as the transformation on the top of the puzzle.",1,1,0

To determine the rule that best describes the top transformation, let's examine the changes from the left image to the right image step-by-step:

1. In the top transformation, the object on the left appears to be a molecule-like structure with pink spheres and smaller white connecting parts, positioned at a specific angle.

2. The object on the right is the same molecule-like structure, but it has been rotated to a new orientation. There is no change in size, number, or color of the object.

3. Thus, the best rule that describes the transformation from the left image to the right image on the top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects.","(1)

To apply the instructions and determine the rotation angle in the transformation at the top of the puzzle, we'll analyze the change from the left image to the right image step-by-step:

1. Identify a Distinctive Feature: The molecule-like structure has distinctive pink spheres connected by smaller white parts. We can use these as our reference points.

2. Determine the Starting Position: In the left image, note the orientation of the spheres and connecting parts. For instance, if looking at a single sphere, observe the direction it is connected to the rest of the structure.

3. Analyze the Ending Position: In the right image, find the same sphere and see where the connecting parts are now pointing in relation to the initial position.

4. Measure the Angle of Rotation: 
   - By comparing the orientation of any distinctive feature (a sphere or connection) in both images, we can determine if the structure has rotated by 90 degrees. If a feature that was initially pointing up is now pointing to the right or left, that’s indicative of a 90-degree rotation.
   - If the feature ends up pointing directly down, it would suggest a 180-degree rotation.

5. Consider the Direction: Note whether the rotation of the features is clockwise or counterclockwise.

6. Conclusion: Observing the transformation from the left to the right image at the top of the puzzle, it appears that the molecule-like structure has been rotated such that features that were pointing in one direction are now pointing to a direction that's perpendicular. This indicates that the object has rotated by 90 degrees.

Thus, the correct rule that describes the transformation for the top images is that objects rotate by 90 degrees (1).","(A)

Let's use the instructions to determine which of the bottom transformations (A), (B), or (C) is the same as the top transformation:

1. Analyze the Top Transformation:
   - The left-to-right transformation on the top involved a rotation without changing the size, number, or color of the object.

2. Compare to Bottom Transformations (A), (B), and (C):
   - (A) shows an object (a 3D representation of an eye or similar) that has been rotated, and there's no change in size, number, or color.
   - (B) shows the same object but flipped vertically, which represents a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis.
   - (C) shows the same object but flipped horizontally, which represents a 180-degree rotation along the vertical axis.

3. Identify Matching Transformation:
   - Since the top transformation is a 90-degree rotation, we are looking for a 90-degree rotation among the bottom options.
   
4. Eliminate Non-matching Options:
   - Option (B) presents a 180-degree flip, not a 90-degree rotation, so we eliminate it.
   - Option (C) also presents a 180-degree flip, so we eliminate it as well.
   - Only option (A) shows an object that has been rotated without any flips, similar to the transformation observed on top.

5. Confirm Your Selection:
   - The transformation in (A) shows the object being rotated in a similar manner to the molecule-like structure in the top transformation, with no flips, size changes, or number changes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observe the object in the top set of images - it appears to be a ship or a boat. The left image shows the boat with its bow (front) pointing upward, while in the right image, the orientation is changed such that the bow is pointing to the right.

2. This change from the left image to the right image on the top is purely a rotation of the object. There is no change in color, number, or size of the object.

3. Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is the change in orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Identify a Reference Point:** On the top left image, we can take the bow (the front part) of the boat as a reference point, which is facing upwards.

2. **Observe Initial Orientation:** In the starting position, the reference point (the bow) is pointing vertically upward.

3. **Compare to Final Orientation:** In the top right image, the reference point has moved to a position that is perpendicular to its initial orientation; the bow is now pointing to the right.

4. **Consider Direction of Rotation:** If you trace the path the bow takes from facing up to facing right, it is a clockwise rotation.

5. **Confirm Degree of Rotation:** Since the reference point moved from facing upward to facing right, this indicates a 90-degree rotational change from the initial position.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the object rotates by 90 degrees, corresponding to rule number (1).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Understand the Top Transformation:**
   - The top transformation involves a 90-degree clockwise rotation from the starting to the ending position.

2. **Examine Each Bottom Transformation:**
   - (A) shows a bunch of grapes with no apparent rotation or other changes from left to right.
   - (B) also shows bunches of grapes with no apparent rotation or change from left to right.
   - (C) shows a bunch of grapes that has been rotated; the stem points to the left in the first image and points down in the second image.

3. **Match Transformation Types:**
   - Transformation (C) is the only one that shows a change in orientation, similar to the one observed on the top transformation.

4. **Check Consistency in the Details:**
   - The rotation in (C) is a 90-degree clockwise rotation. In the first image, the stem points leftwards, and in the second image, it points downwards.

5. **Identify the Correct Transformation:**
   - Since (C) matches the type and degree of rotation seen in the top transformation, it is the correct one.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top transformation shows a log with a particular orientation on the left which is then rotated or flipped in the image on the right.
- This rotation is evidenced by the cut section of the log that changes from being on the top left in the starting image to being on the top right in the ending image.
- The color, size, and number of the logs remain consistent between the two images.
- This indicates that the transformation rule for the images on the top involves a change in orientation. Hence, the correct rule that describes the left-to-right transformation on the top is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify a distinct feature on the log. We can use the cut end of the log which is colored differently as a reference.

2. Look at the starting position: the distinct, cut end of the log is facing upward to the left.

3. Observe the ending position: the distinct, cut end of the log is now facing downward to the right.

4. The movement of the distinct feature is perpendicular to its original starting position; it moved from the top left to the bottom right. This indicates a rotation on a plane, not just a flip. It has moved through one quadrant, which suggests a 90-degree rotation.

5. The rotation direction is clockwise, as the distinct end moved from the top left to the bottom right.

6. The log has not been rotated a full 180 degrees since the feature did not end up directly opposite its starting position.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that objects rotate by 90 degrees.","To determine which one of the three bottom transformations (marked by (A), (B), or (C)) matches the top transformation of the log, we use the previous conclusion that the log on top undergoes a 90-degree rotation.

Let's analyze each bottom transformation step by step:

(A) shows a mouse that appears to have been rotated or flipped, but it's not clear if this is a 90-degree rotation as the mouse's orientation has changed significantly from facing left to facing upward with its back.

(B) also shows a rotation, but this time the orientation of the mouse changes from facing left to its nose pointing down; this suggests that the mouse has been flipped upside down in a way that could correspond to a 180-degree turn rather than 90 degrees.

(C) shows the mouse with its orientation changed from facing up to facing the right side, which is a quarter turn or 90-degree rotation.

Comparing these to the top transformation:
- Transformation (A) is not a simple 90-degree rotation; it's more of a flip with an unknown degree of rotation.
- Transformation (B) is closer to a 180-degree flip rather than a 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (C) shows a 90-degree rotation in the same manner observed in the top transformation of the log.

Based on these observations:

(C) Transformation (C) is the one that matches the top transformation of the log, which involves a 90-degree rotation. The mouse goes from facing one way and ends up facing a direction that is perpendicular to the start, just like the log does in the top transformation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",1,0,1

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The image on top shows a grand piano at the starting position on the left.
- The same piano is shown on the right at the ending position.
- Comparing the two images, it's clear that the piano rotates or changes its orientation.
- The left image shows the piano at an angle, where the keyboard is more visible and seems to be facing slightly towards us.
- The right image shows the piano at a different angle, where the keyboard is less visible and seems to be facing more away from us.
- No other changes are visible between the two pictures; the number, size, and color of the piano remain unchanged.
- Hence, the transformation that best describes the change from the left to the right picture of the piano is the change in orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- First, we establish a reference point on the grand piano in the top images. Let's use the keyboard or leg of the piano as the reference point.

- Looking at the initial position of the piano, the keyboard or the leg of the piano is visible and facing towards us at a certain angle.

- In the final position of the piano, the keyboard or the leg is less visible and the angle has clearly changed, indicating a rotation.

- To determine the angle of rotation, we notice that the orientation change of the piano is significant, but the top of the piano is not upside down, which would suggest a 180-degree rotation.

- The direction of the rotation appears to be roughly 90 degrees to the right (in a clockwise direction) because the change in angle is such that the keyboard and front of the piano shift from facing towards us to facing more to the right.

- Confirming consistency, we observe that the overall shape and features of the piano align with a 90-degree rotation.

- Since the reference point and overall piano orientation suggest it has turned to a perpendicular position relative to the initial orientation, we conclude a 90-degree rotation has occurred.

Therefore, rule number (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees best describes the transformation of the piano from the left picture to the right picture in the top of the puzzle.","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the Transformation Type:
   - From the top images, we have already established that the transformation involves a rotation, specifically a 90-degree rotation of the object.

2. Establish Reference Points:
   - Considering the same reference points or aspects in the bottom transformations, we look for changes in the orientation that match the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.

3. Examine Each Bottom Transformation:
   - (A) Shows two angular objects, where the one on the right is rotated approximately 90 degrees from the left.
   - (B) Also shows two angular objects, but there is no apparent rotation between the left and right images – they look identical.
   - (C) Shows two angular objects, but the one on the right is not just rotated, it is also vertically aligned, which is a different kind of transformation from what we see on top.

4. Compare Transformations:
   - Only transformation (A) has a visible rotation that could be approximately 90 degrees.

5. Check for Consistency:
   - The transformation in (A) consistently shows a rotation without any other changes, like a change in the number of objects or their size and color.

6. Eliminate Non-matching Options:
   - Options (B) and (C) do not exhibit the same type of rotation change as the one in the top image, so we can eliminate these options.

7. Confirm the Match:
   - The bottom transformation that matches the 90-degree rotation from the top images is option (A), which depicts a rotation of one object from one position to another, maintaining the same number, size, and color, much like the transformation of the piano above.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is (A) for the transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle.",1,0,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Upon observing the top transformation, we see that there are two distinct components of the object: a piece of cake and a strawberry on top.
2. Between the left and right images, the size of the cake and the strawberry remains the same, so rule (1) for size changes does not apply.
3. The color of both the cake and the strawberry remains consistent between the two images, which tells us that rule (3) for color changes is not the one we are looking for.
4. There are no additional or missing objects between the two images, indicating that there is no change in the number of objects, so rule (4) is not relevant.
5. What changes is the orientation of the cake and strawberry: initially, the cake is upright with the strawberry on top, and in the transformed image, the cake and strawberry are upside down. This indicates that the transformation involves a change in orientation.
6. Since rule (5) states 'Doesn't apply', which is not the case here, we eliminate rule (5) as well.
7. Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects, which is designated as rule (2).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify a Reference Point:** The strawberry on top of the cake can serve as a distinct reference point, as it's easily identifiable in both the initial and final positions.

2. **Assess Initial Position:** Initially, the strawberry's tip is pointing upward, which we can use as the 'up' direction for our reference point.

3. **Assess Final Position:** In the final position, the strawberry's tip is now pointing downward.

4. **Calculate Rotation:** The movement of the tip of the strawberry from 'up' to 'down' indicates that the strawberry — along with the cake — has undergone a rotation. The change in orientation is such that the 'up' direction of our reference point now points directly 'down'. This suggests a rotation of 180 degrees.

5. **Confirm Direction:** The direction of the rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) is not explicitly needed to determine the degree of rotation in this case since a 180-degree rotation results in the same orientation regardless of the rotation direction.

6. **Compare with Other Objects:** There are no other objects for comparison, but the upside-down position of the cake and strawberry compared to the initial position is enough to confirm a 180-degree rotation.

Therefore, rule (2) for objects rotating by 180 degrees best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the Top Transformation:** The transformation at the top of the puzzle involves the cake and strawberry rotating by 180 degrees, as identified from the positioning of the strawberry from up to down.

2. **Analyze Each Bottom Transformation:**
   - (A) shows a shoe that is rotated but not fully upside down, suggesting a rotation less than 180 degrees.
   - (B) shows a shoe that has not been rotated at all; it remains in the same orientation from left to right.
   - (C) shows a shoe that starts upright and ends upside down, indicating a rotation of 180 degrees.

3. **Compare Types of Changes:** 
   - Transformation (A) involves rotation, but not by 180 degrees.
   - Transformation (B) involves no rotation at all.
   - Transformation (C) involves a 180-degree rotation, which matches the type of change observed in the top transformation.

4. **Match Detail for Detail:** Transformation (C) not only involves a rotation but it also matches the 180-degree rotation seen in the top transformation, where the object is upright in the first image and upside down in the second.

5. **Eliminate Non-matching Options:** Transformation (A) does not match because the degree of rotation is less than 180 degrees, and (B) is eliminated because there is no rotation at all.

6. **Identify the Matching Transformation:** The matching transformation is (C), as this is the only one that undergoes a 180-degree rotation similar to the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Let's start by looking at the top transformation featuring the action figure. In the starting position on the left, the figure is upright. In the ending position on the right, the figure is upside down.

2. There is no change in the color, size, or number of figures between the two images; the only change is in the orientation.

3. This transformation matches rule (1), which states that the orientation of objects changes from the left image to the right image.

So, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is (1) Orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Establish a reference point:** The action figure in the top transformation is distinct and has several recognizable features such as the eyes, the spider symbol on the chest, or the positioning of the limbs.

2. **Compare orientations:** In the first image, the figure is upright, with its head on top, feet on the bottom, and the spider symbol facing front. In the second image, the figure is upside down, with its head now at the bottom, feet at the top, and the spider symbol still visible from the front.

3. **Determine the degree of rotation:**
    - If we use the head as the reference point, in the first image, it is at the top and in the second image at the bottom. This is a clear indication of a 180-degree rotation because the head is now on the direct opposite side of its original position.
    - We can also infer this by imagining a line running vertically through the figure. In the transition from the first to the second image, this line looks like it has been flipped to an upside-down position which further indicates a 180-degree rotation.

4. **Consistency check:** Other features such as the limbs and the orientation of the spider symbol on the figure's chest support the conclusion that the rotation is the same across the entire figure, which is by 180 degrees.

There is no 90-degree turn where the action figure would be on its side. Instead, the figure is completely inverted (flipped upside down), hence the 180-degree turn. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation on top of the puzzle is (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the top transformation:** In the top transformation, the action figure is rotated by 180 degrees going from an upright position to an upside-down position. There is no change in color, number, or size.

2. **Establish a reference point for the top transformation:** The head of the action figure, which moves from the top in the first image to the bottom in the second image, can be a reference point.

3. **Examine each of the bottom transformations (A, B, and C) individually:**
    - **(A):** The squirrel on the left is facing right with its legs at the bottom, and the squirrel on the right is in the same orientation. There is no rotation here, so this does not match the top transformation.
    - **(B):** The squirrel on the left has the legs facing left and the squirrel on the right is flipped upside down. This is a clear rotation; however, the appearance of the flip seems to be more than 90 degrees but not a full 180 degrees because the squirrel appears to be on its back rather than completely inverted. So this is not the same as the action figure.
    - **(C):** The squirrel on the left side is oriented with its front facing up, and on the right side, it has been rotated to where its front is now facing down. This is a rotation of 180 degrees and matches the same rotation seen in the top transformation.

4. **Eliminate non-matching transformations:** Transformation (A) does not show any rotation, and transformation (B) does not complete a full 180-degree rotation.

5. **Confirm the match:** Only transformation (C) shows the squirrel being flipped completely upside down, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation as seen in the top transformation of the action figure.

6. **Select the correct transformation:** The correct choice is (C) because it matches the",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top transformation, we see a cup of coffee with a latte art design on the left.
- On the right, we have the same cup, but it is rotated, so we view it from the top, which changes the orientation.
- There is no change in color, number, or size of the object. There is also a change between the pictures, so rule (4) does not apply.
- Since the orientation of the object is the only thing that changes from the left image to the right image in the top transformation, rule (2) ""Orientation of objects"" best describes the transformation.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify Reference Points:
   - In the top transformation, we choose the handle of the cup and the design on the coffee's surface as reference points.

2. Compare Initial and Final Positions:
   - In the initial position, the handle is located on the side of the cup, and the coffee design is seen from a side perspective.
   - In the final position, the handle is not visible (indicating it is either directly facing us or away from us), and the coffee design is seen from a top-down perspective.

3. Analyze the Rotation:
   - The change from a side perspective to a top-down view is typically indicative of a 90-degree rotation.
   - Since the handle is directly facing up or down (not visible from the top view), this supports the idea of a 90-degree rotation rather than a 180-degree rotation, which would have the handle still visible but on the opposite side.

4. Consistency Check:
   - Both the coffee design and handle support the conclusion that the cup has been rotated by 90 degrees.

5. Use Imaginary Lines:
   - If we draw an imaginary line horizontally through the cup in the initial position, in the final position, this line would now be vertical due to the 90-degree rotation.

By following these analytical steps, we conclude that the correct rule that describes the change from the first cup to the second is a 90-degree rotation, which is rule (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Understand the Top Transformation:
   - The top transformation involves a rotation of the coffee cup. It rotates from a side view to a top view, which we've identified as a 90-degree rotation.

2. Identify Key Characteristics:
   - The key characteristic of the top transformation is a 90-degree rotation without any changes in color, size, or number of objects.

3. Evaluate Each Bottom Transformation:
   - (A) shows two identical figures side by side with no change between them, indicating no transformation.
   - (B) shows the figure changing in orientation and part of the figure is elongated or changed in shape.
   - (C) shows the figure rotating and, as a result of the rotation, a different part of the figure is now facing us.

4. Compare Characteristics:
   - Transformations (A) and (B) do not match the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.
   - Transformation (C) shows the figure being viewed from the front to being viewed from the side, which can correspond to a 90-degree rotation around a vertical axis.

5. Eliminate Non-Matching Options:
   - Eliminate (A) as it shows no change, and eliminate (B) as it does not show a simple rotation but also an elongation or part alteration.

6. Confirm Matching Transformation:
   - After comparing, only option (C) has the same 90-degree rotation characteristic as the top transformation.

7. Double-Check:
   - Double-check (C) to make sure it is only the orientation that has changed, without any alteration in color, size, or number of objects, just like the top transformation.

By following these steps, we can conclude that option (C) is the one that matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top part of the puzzle, we observe a transformation of the object from the left to the right.
- The object on the left is a toy plane seen from above, showcasing its wings and top part of the fuselage.
- The object on the right is the same plane, but now it is shown in a side view, with the wings oriented differently relative to the viewer's perspective.
- There is no change in color, number of planes, or size of the plane. The only change is in the orientation of the plane relative to the viewer.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- First, we need to identify a reference point on the object in the left picture at the top of the puzzle. A suitable reference point could be the front part of the plane or the propeller.
- In the initial orientation, the reference point (for example, the propeller) is facing upwards when considering the plane's orientation from above.
- Next, we observe the final orientation of the object in the right picture. The plane is now viewed from the side, and the reference point (the propeller) that was initially facing upwards is now facing either the right or left side.
- Since the reference point has moved perpendicularly to its original position, making a quarter of a full rotation, this indicates a 90-degree rotation of the plane.
- All other features of the object are consistent with this degree of rotation.
- Thus, the rule that best describes this transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Analyze the top transformation, which we previously identified as a 90-degree rotation change in the orientation of the object.

2. Examine each bottom transformation to find one that displays a 90-degree rotation:
   - In (A), the plane rotates such that the top is facing the viewer in the second image. This is a rotation, but it is not a 90-degree rotation with respect to the viewer; it's more of a flip to face the camera.
   - In (B), the plane is shown from the top in both images and appears to rotate slightly; however, it does not rotate 90 degrees between the two images.
   - In (C), the plane rotates from a top-down view in the first image to a side view in the second image. This matches the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.

3. Match the characteristics:
   - The top transformation involves a 90-degree rotation from a bird's-eye view to a side view.
   - Transformation (C) is the only one that also moves from a bird's-eye view to a side view, indicating a 90-degree rotation.

4. Confirm the Match:
   - The type of change from the top transformation is identical to the change seen in option (C) on the bottom of the puzzle.

5. Select the Correct Choice:
   - The bottom transformation that matches the top one in terms of a 90-degree rotation change is (C).",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top transformation, we see the same object, a green hat, in both the left and right images.
- The only change that occurs from the left image to the right image is that the hat on the right is rotated or tipped over compared to the hat on the left.
- There is no change in size, number, or color of the hat; it is merely turned on its side.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Establish a reference frame: The hat's brim and the band with the buckle are distinctive features that can be used as a reference.

2. Compare the initial and final positions: In the initial position, the hat brim is horizontal, and the buckle is visible on the side of the hat. In the final position, the brim appears vertical, and the buckle is not visible as it would be facing downwards based on the hat's new orientation.

3. Visualize the rotation on a plane: If we consider the hat as if it were lying flat on a plane in the initial image, its brim is parallel to the plane's surface. After the transformation, the brim is perpendicular to the plane's surface, suggesting a quarter-turn, which is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation.

4. Check the axis of rotation: The hat has rotated around a horizontal axis going through the center of the hat, considering its placement in the initial and final images.

5. Use other objects for context: There are no other surrounding objects to compare to, but the orientation change is clear from analyzing the hat's features.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the object (the hat) rotates by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the transformation on top: The transformation involves the green hat rotating approximately 90 degrees around a horizontal axis.

2. Identify key characteristics: The distinctive characteristic of the transformation is the rotation of the object without any change in size, color, or number.

3. Examine each option systematically:
   - Looking at option (A), the bookcase rotates but it flips upside down, which is not the same as the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.
   - In option (B), the bookcase rotates, with the unique segmented part that sticks out being on the side in the first image and on the top in the second image, suggesting a 90-degree rotation similar to the hat's rotation.
   - Option (C) also shows a rotation, but it appears to be a different amount of rotation, possibly a 180-degree rotation since the unique segmented part that sticks out goes from one side in the first image to the opposite side in the second image, without showing the bottom or top view.

4. Compare and contrast:
   - Compare each bottom transformation's changes to the 90-degree rotation of the top transformation.
   - Options (A) and (C) clearly show a different kind of rotation compared to the top transformation.

5. Eliminate dissimilar transformations:
   - Option (A) involves a 180-degree flip, not a 90-degree rotation.
   - Option (C) also seems to involve a 180-degree flip similar to option (A).

6. Confirm the matching transformation:
   - Option (B) exhibits a rotation similar to the top transformation, as both involve rotating around a horizontal axis by 90 degrees without any flipping or changes in other characteristics.

7. Select the correct option:
   - After thorough examination and comparison, option (B) is determined to be the correct choice that matches the top transformation because it's the only transformation that includes a simple 90-degree rotation along",1,0,1

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the top transformation, we observe that the object (walkie-talkie) remains the same in color, size, and number.
2. The only change we notice is that the walkie-talkie has been rotated so that the antenna faces upwards in the left image and downwards in the right image.
3. Hence, the transformation that has taken place is related to the orientation of the object.
4. Therefore, rule (3) Orientation of objects accurately describes the transformation.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify Fixed Points: The antenna and buttons on the walkie-talkie serve as fixed points that can be observed to determine the rotation.

2. Compare Before and After Positions: In the starting image, the antenna of the walkie-talkie is facing up, and in the ending image, it's facing down directly opposite to its original position.

3. Use Right-Angle References: If the antenna had rotated 90 degrees from its initial upward position, it would be pointing either to the left or the right in the ending image. However, it is not perpendicular to its starting position; it's directly flipped.

4. Use Opposite Position for 180 Degrees: As observed, the antenna has moved to a position directly opposite its initial orientation, indicating it has made a half-turn.

5. Check Alignment: The antenna was at the top originally, and it remains at the top in the ending position but has inverted. This orientation change is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.

By following these steps, we can confirm that the transformation involves the walkie-talkie being rotated 180 degrees, which aligns with rule (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Assess the Top Transformation: The top transformation shows a walkie-talkie rotating 180 degrees from left to right.

2. Identify Key Characteristics: The key characteristic of the top transformation is that the walkie-talkie is flipped upside down, maintaining its shape and color but changing its orientation.

3. Compare with Bottom Transformations:
    - Transformation (A) shows a cake with no apparent changes in orientation or any other aspect between the left and the right images.
    - Transformation (B) also shows a cake, but unlike (A), the cake rotates 180 degrees from left to right, as indicated by the ""Happy Birthday"" text being upside down in the right image.
    - Transformation (C) shows a cake but with a change in perspective/angle rather than a precise rotation; the text is readable in both pictures, which does not match a 180-degree rotation.

4. Eliminate Non-Matching Transformations: Transformation (A) does not involve rotation, so it does not match. Transformation (C) changes the angle the cake is seen from but does not represent a 180-degree rotation.

5. Confirm the Matching Transformation: Transformation (B) is the only one that includes a 180-degree rotation, matching the key characteristic of the top transformation.

6. Choose the Correct Option: Based on the observation that both the walkie-talkie in the top transformation and the cake in transformation (B) are flipped upside down, (B) is the correct answer.

The transformation at the bottom of the puzzle that matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is (B), where the cake is rotated 180 degrees from left to right.",1,1,0

- There are two images of ducks at the top of the puzzle. The left image shows a duck facing to the left, and the right image shows a duck facing to the right. The number of ducks, their size, and their color remain unchanged.
- The only difference between the two images is the orientation of the duck; it is rotated 180 degrees along the vertical axis.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this left-to-right transformation is the change in the orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Identify a Reference Point: In the image of the duck at the top of the puzzle, we can use the duck's beak or its tail as reference points.
- Initial Orientation: In the initial image on the left, the duck faces to the left, meaning the beak points to the left side of the image.
- Compare to the New Position: In the transformed image on the right, the duck now faces to the right, with the beak pointing to the right side of the image.
- Measure Rotation: Since the beak of the duck has flipped from pointing left to pointing right, the duck has rotated 180 degrees around its vertical axis.
- Check Consistency: The entire duck has been flipped without any changes to the other attributes (like size, number, or color), indicating a consistent 180-degree rotation.

Therefore, the transformation rule that best describes the change from the left picture to the right picture at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which is rule number (1).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the Top Transformation:**
   The transformation at the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the duck from left to right without any change in size, number, or color.

2. **Identify Key Features:**
   The key feature of this transformation is the horizontal flip, or 180-degree rotation.

3. **Inspect Each Bottom Transformation:**
   Now we will inspect transformations (A), (B), and (C).

4. **Compare Changes in (A):**
   Transformation (A) shows a character facing forward in the left image and upside down in the right image. This is not a horizontal flip—it's a vertical flip.

5. **Compare Changes in (B):**
   Transformation (B) shows a character facing forward in the left image and then the character is facing backward in the right image, while remaining upright. This matches a 180-degree rotation on the vertical axis, similar to the top transformation.

6. **Compare Changes in (C):**
   Transformation (C) shows no change in orientation from the left image to the right image. So this does not match the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation on top shows a couch in two different states.
2. Looking at the left image, the couch is in an upright position, which is its normal orientation.
3. In the right image, the couch is tilted back so that the bottom is no longer resting on the ground and leans to one side.
4. The size of the couch does not change between the two images.
5. The number of couches remains the same; only one couch is present in both images.
6. The color of the couch does not change; it is the same shade of gray in both images.
7. The only change that occurs is the rotation or tilting of the couch, indicating a change in orientation.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Establish Reference Points:**
   - Observe the couch in the left image and identify distinct points that will help to gauge the rotation. We can use the orientation of the armrests and cushions as our reference points.

2. **Analyze the Starting Position:**
   - In the left image, the couch's armrests and seating area have a specific orientation relative to the ground—the armrests are vertically aligned, and the cushions are horizontal.

3. **Observe the Ending Position:**
   - Look at the couch in the right image and locate the same reference points, the armrests, and cushions.

4. **Determine the Rotation Angle:**
   - The armrests that were vertical in the starting image are now horizontal in the ending image, and the cushions that were horizontal are now vertical.
   - Given this shift in the reference points, it is not a 90-degree rotation, as that would only have placed the armrests and cushions at a different angle, not completely reversed their orientation.

5. **Confirm the Rotation:**
   - The couch has been rotated in such a way that the top now faces the front and the bottom is at the top. This indicates the couch has been flipped over onto its back—a 180-degree rotation around its horizontal axis.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the reference points have moved to positions directly opposite to where they started, we can confirm that the transformation involves the couch rotating by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Top Transformation:**
   - As previously analyzed, the transformation at the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the couch, changing its orientation from upright to flipped onto its back.

2. **Examine Each Bottom Transformation:**
   - Observe the transformations in the sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

   - Transformation (A) shows no change in orientation between the left and right images.
   - Transformation (B) shows a change in orientation but not a complete 180-degree flip. The object appears to have rotated less than 180 degrees since it is now lying on its side rather than being flipped upside down.
   - Transformation (C) displays an object that looks upright in the left image and flipped upside down in the right image, indicating a 180-degree rotation.

3. **Match Internal Consistencies:**
   - Comparing the changes in transformations (A), (B), and (C) with the top transformation, only (C) has consistent changes with the top transformation, which involves a 180-degree rotation.

4. **Rule Out Differences:**
   - Eliminate transformations (A) and (B) because they do not match the full 180-degree rotation observed in the top transformation. (A) shows no rotation, and (B) is not a full 180-degree flip.

5. **Look for Similar Reference Points:**
   - The bottom and top of the object in transformation (C) switch places from left to right, akin to the reference points (armrests and cushions) of the couch at the top.

6. **Final Comparison:**
   - After comparing the transformations, (C) matches the top transformation's 180-degree rotation change. The object in (C) changes orientation from an upright position to a flipped upside-down position, just as the couch does.
