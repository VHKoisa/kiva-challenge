Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top part of the visual puzzle, we see a transformation of a dog. The dog is first shown in an upright position and then in an upside-down orientation. There is no change in color, size, or number, only in the orientation.

- Now we'll review the bottom transformations one by one:

(A) The object (a submarine) shows a shift in horizontal position but retains the same orientation.
(B) The object rotates 180 degrees vertically, akin to the dog's transformation from upright to upside-down.
(C) The object shifts in size, becoming smaller, without any change in orientation or number.

- Since the transformation in the bottom set that matches the top transformer's change of orientation is (B), where the object is also flipping 180 degrees vertically, we can conclude that (B) is the correct answer following the given picture's pattern.",0,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the top, we see a transformation involving a dog. The dog is initially in an upright position and then is flipped upside down.

2. Looking at the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle:
   - (A) shows the object rotated 90 degrees to stand upright.
   - (B) shows the object rotated about its lateral axis, similar to the flip observed in the dog's transformation.
   - (C) shows the object changing size; it gets bigger from the first to the second image.

3. The transformation that matches the top is therefore the one where the object has been flipped about its lateral axis without any other changes, corresponding to (B).",1,2DRotation180
0,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation at the top, we have two images of a dog. The dog goes from an upright, standing position to an upside-down position. The changes involve rotation and orientation but not size, number, or color.

2. Looking at the transformations presented in the options (A), (B), and (C), we need to find an analogous transformation that involves a change in orientation.

3. Option (A) shows a submarine that changes from horizontal to vertical. The change is in orientation, but unlike the dog, which flips over completely to be upside down, the submarine does not flip but rather stands on its tail. This is not the same as the transformation on top.

4. Option (B) shows a submarine that changes from horizontal to an orientation that has the submarine upside down, similar to the dog's transformation. It involves the same rotation change from the initial position to an upside-down position.

5. Option (C) shows a change in size, with the second submarine being smaller than the first one. This does not match the type of change we see with the dog, which does not involve a change in size.

Thus, the submarine transformation that best matches the transformation of the dog is found in (B).",1,2DRotation180

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to identify the transformation that occurs from the left object to the right object in both the top example and the three options (A), (B), and (C).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the top transformation:
1. The first image shows a table fan facing left.
2. The second image shows the same fan rotated so that it's now facing down.

Now let's analyze the transformations for each of the options (A), (B), and (C):

Option (A):
1. The first image shows a box of fries straight up.
2. The second image shows the box of fries in the same orientation and position.

Option (B):
1. The first image shows a box of fries facing up.
2. The second image shows the box of fries tilted forward, with the fries pouring out.

Option (C):
1. The first image shows a box of fries that is upright.
2. The second image shows the fries standing on the side of the box.

The transformation that matches the top example (fan rotating to face down) is Option (B), where the box of fries is also rotated, resulting in the fries pouring out. It's not a perfect analog to the top example since the fan has a pivot and the box of fries does not, but it's the closest in terms of the change in orientation.

Options (A) and (C) show changes but do not",0,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a fan that is initially facing left and then is turned to face right without any other changes to its features (such as size, color, or number of parts).

2. Let's analyze each of the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a pack of fries that seems to be dropping or losing fries from left to right.
   - (B) depicts the pack of fries rotating from facing left to facing right, with no fries being added or removed, and no changes in size or color.
   - (C) shows two instances of the pack of fries where there are no changes in orientation, number, size, or color.

3. Option (B) matches the top transformation in terms of direction change, without altering other features. Therefore, it correctly mirrors the type of transformation occurring with the fan in the top row. 

Hence, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation is (B).",1,2DRotation180

To solve the visual puzzle, examine the transformation occurring on top and compare it with the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) below.

Looking at the top transformation of the object, it appears that the electric fan rotates from an upright position to a position where it is lying on its side.

Now, observe the bottom transformations:

- (A) shows a box of fries remaining upright in both images, without any rotation or tipping over.
- (B) shows the box of fries rotating from an upright position to a position where it is on its side.
- (C) shows a box of fries that not only tips over but also seems to discharge its contents.

The transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle is a rocking horse that goes from an upright position to being tipped over on its side. When examining the three options (A), (B), and (C) for their transformations from left to right, we should look for a similar type of transformation.

Option (A) shows no change in orientation, size, number, or color between the two instances of the object: it depicts an upright toy-like figure facing the same direction in both images.

Option (B) shows the toy-like figure being rotated onto its side from the first image to the second.

Option (C) shows the same toy-like figure being rotated in such a way that it is upside down in the second image in relation to the first.

The transformation that matches the top puzzle's transformation most closely is (B), where the object undergoes a similar change in orientation from standing upright to being on its side.",0,No change

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle first. We can see a rocking horse that is positioned normally on the left and then flipped upside down on the right. This indicates that the transformation involves a change in orientation from right-side-up to upside-down.

Now, let's examine the three options (A), (B), and (C) for the second object:

(A) shows a figure that is rotated but remains right-side-up in both images.
(B) shows the figure right-side-up in the first image and then flipped upside-down in the second image, which is the same transformation observed in the top puzzle.
(C) shows the figure from a slightly different angle but also remains right-side-up in both images.

1. Looking at the top-row transformation, we see that the change happening from the left to the right is an upside-down flip of the rocking horse.
2. Now, examining the bottom-row transformations one by one:
   - For (A), the toy has rotated counterclockwise. This is not the same transformation as the flip seen in the top row.
   - For (B), the toy has also been flipped upside down, similar to the rocking horse in the top row. This matches the top-row transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top, we observe a change from left to right in the orientation and color of the object. The molecular structure rotates, and the color of the atoms changes from pink to gray.

2. Looking at the options:

- (A) shows a change in the orientation of the object; however, there is no change in color.
- (B) shows no change in orientation or color.
- (C) shows a change in both orientation and the color of the object's components. The object's eye changes color from blue to gray, and there is a rotation, as evidenced by the position of the eye and ears.

3. (C) is the only one that matches the type of transformation of the object on the top because it involves both a change in color and orientation, parallel to how the top object changes the color of its elements and rotates position. 

So, the answer is (C).",1,2DRotation180
3,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- First, let's identify the transformation happening on the top part of the puzzle with the pink object. The object on the left has its elements (pink spheres and grey connectors) pointing in various directions, while the object on the right maintains the same number of elements but is presented in a symmetrical configuration, with the pink spheres opposing each other on opposite ends of a central axis.

- Now, let's analyze the transformations of the three objects (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom of the puzzle:
  - Option (A): The object's eye is looking left in the first image and looks right in the second image. There's no change in symmetry or orientation that matches the top transformation, so this is not the correct answer.
  - Option (B): The first image shows an object with features (ears) pointing upwards and the second shows these ears rotated to a horizontal position, creating a mirror-image symmetry similar to the transformation observed in the top images. This transformation mirrors the original transformation seen at the top, as it changes the object to a symmetrical state across an imaginary horizontal axis, just as the top transformation does along a vertical axis.
  - Option (C): The first image shows the object rotated to the left and the second shows it rotated to the right. Similar to option A, this is a simple change in orientation and does not reflect the symmetrical transformation observed in the top images",1,2DRotation180
3,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (C).

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation from left to right for the object on top and then apply the same transformation logic to each of the three sets of objects at the bottom.

Top Transformation:
- The first image on the top shows an object with a certain configuration.
- The second image shows a version of the same object that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- The third image shows the same object increased in size following the rotation.

Now, let's apply this transformation logic to the choices at the bottom:

(A) This shows an object which appears to remain consistent in size but is being rotated. The first to the second image is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. However, the size does not change in the third image, which disqualifies it from matching the top transformation.
(B) This series also depicts an object being rotated. The first image rotates 90 degrees clockwise and remains consistent, but there is no increase in size at the third image.
(C) Here, we see the initial object in the series remaining consistent in size from the first to the second image, followed by a rotation 90 degrees clockwise, then the size increases from the second to the third image.

Thus, option (C) follows the same transformation logic found in the top transformation, which is a rotation followed by an increase in size.",1,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation of the object, which is a ship. The ship changes orientation from the first to the second image. Specifically, it appears to rotate, going from an upright position on the sea to capsized.

2. Examine option (A): The grape cluster remains in the same orientation but reduces in size from the first to the second image. This is not a match, as the ship's transformation involved a change in orientation, not size.

3. Examine option (B): The grape cluster changes orientation by flipping its position vertically. This is closer to the top transformation, but it's not quite the same, as the ship does not simply flip vertically; it appears to undergo a broader rotation.

4. Examine option (C): The grape cluster seems to rotate around its stem, changing its orientation in a way that more closely resembles the ship’s rotation from upright to capsized.

Since option (C) is the only transformation with a similar change in orientation, it is the correct analogy to the transformation of the ship at the top of the puzzle.",0,No change

(A) This transformation shows two identical images of a bunch of grapes with no change in orientation, size, number, or color.

(B) This transformation also shows two identical images of a bunch of grapes with no change in orientation, size, number, or color.

(C) The transformation shows a bunch of grapes that is flipped upside down in the second image. This mirrors the transformation of the ship on top where one object is flipped vertically, thus changing its orientation.

The transformation involves a change in orientation from a horizontal to a vertical position.

(A) Shows a bunch of grapes with one orientation on the left and a slightly rotated orientation on the right. This does not match the top transformation, which involves a change from horizontal to vertical.

(B) Shows the bunch of grapes oriented horizontally in the first frame and then oriented vertically in the second frame. This matches the transformation seen at the top.

Now looking at the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C):

- (A): Shows a mouse with a change in orientation, but it is more like the mouse is flipping over, not rotating around its longitudinal axis.
- (B): Shows a mouse where the orientation changes from facing left to facing partially downwards. This resembles a rotation around its longitudinal axis, similar to the log on the top transformation.
- (C): Shows a mouse that also appears to be flipping over rather than rotating around its longitudinal axis.

- The object (which appears to be a wooden log) is rotated from a position where the cut flat end is on the right to a position where that end is facing upwards.

(A) The object is rotated about 90 degrees counterclockwise from the first to the second image and then rotated again about 90 degrees counterclockwise from the second to the third image. This transformation differs from the top transformation because it involves two rotations without a flip.

(B) The object is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise from the first to the second image, very similar to the transformation of the piano on top. Then from the second to the third image, the object is flipped horizontally, which is also the same transformation seen in the piano. Therefore, this sequence matches the top transformation.

(C) The object is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise from the first to the second image but appears to be rotated counterclockwise from the second to the third image. This does not match the top transformation since it involves two different rotations, without a flip.

3. In option (B), one road barrier gets placed on top of the other, changing the configuration from side by side to one above the other without rotation or change of orientation. This is not the same transformation observed with the grand piano either.

4. Finally, in option (C), we see that the vertical road barrier rotates onto its side next to the other barrier, making it stand vertically. This is a change in orientation, similar to the rotation and change in orientation seen with the grand piano in the top series of images.

    a. The object rotates.
    b. The object (cake) becomes smaller while retaining its other characteristics (color and relative position of the strawberry).

Bottom Transformations (Shoes):
Now let's compare the transformations happening with the shoe in each bottom sequence:

(A) The shoe size remains the same, and only the orientation is changed slightly in both steps. There's no reduction in size, so it does not match the transformation at the top.
(B) The shoe first changes its orientation slightly, and then in the second step, it reduces in size along with another slight rotation. This matches the transformation at the top (orientation change and size reduction).
(C) The shoe only rotates, with no size change. This sequence only matches the orientation change and not the size reduction seen at the top.

The transformation that matches the one at the top, with both a rotation and a size reduction, is option (B).",1,2DRotation180

To arrive at the answer, let's evaluate the transformation in the top row and apply the same reasoning to the three options in the bottom row.

Top Row Transformation:
- The object is a pistol (a toy or an illustration).
- In the first image, the pistol is upright, the standard position one would hold when ready to fire.
- In the second image, the pistol is on its side. The transformation is a rotation along the longitudinal axis of the gun.

Bottom Row Transformations:
(A) The first and second images show a propeller plane with the first image being upright, and in the second image, the plane is rotated along its longitudinal axis, just like the gun.

(B) The first and second images also show a propeller plane with the first image upright. However, in the second image, the plane is rotated along a transverse axis, meaning the orientation of the plane changes as if it was doing a sideways barrel roll.

(C) This series is similar to (A), with the plane upright in the first image and tilted to one side in the second image, suggesting a rotation around the longitudinal axis, mirroring the transformation of the gun.

The correct analogical transformation that corresponds to the top row is the one where the object rotates along an axis other than the longitudinal one. (A) and (C) both show a rotation along the longitudinal axis, which is not the transformation seen in the top row. (B) shows",1,2DRotation180

Now, let's analyze the transformations on the bottom:

(A) The airplane changes orientation from flying upwards to flying downwards.
(B) The airplane changes orientation by what appears to be a 90-degree rotation to the right, similar to a roll movement in aviation terms.
(C) The airplane flips horizontally, changing the direction it is facing.

Option (B) is the correct transformation that matches the one on top because both involve a 90-degree rotation change in orientation.

   (C) Also shows a shelving unit being rotated, but not from an upright to a flat position - instead, the orientation shifts from facing one way to another while still upright.

First, let's analyze the top transformation of the hats. The transformation involves a rotation around the vertical axis, with the hat turning sideways from the perspective of the viewer.

Now let's review each option step by step:

(A) This bottom transformation shows a geometric structure rotating slightly around a vertical axis; however, the rotation is not as extensive as the transformation of the hat on the top. The leftmost and rightmost images of the structure are similar in orientation compared to the leftmost and rightmost images of the hat. Therefore, this transformation is not the same as the transformation on the top.

(B) This bottom transformation shows the structure rotating around a vertical axis with a significant change in orientation from the first image to the third. It matches the transformation of the hat, which has also rotated to present a different view in the final image. Hence, this holds the same pattern of change as the top transformation.

(C) This bottom transformation shows the structure again rotating slightly in a similar fashion to (A), but not to the same extent as the change in the hat's transformation on the top. The orientation of the structures doesn't match the orientation change seen in the hats because the rightmost structure is not turned on its side as the rightmost hat is.

   - In the middle, the walkie-talkie is rotated about 45 degrees to the right.
   - On the right, the walkie-talkie is shown from a top-down perspective, indicating a further rotation.

2. Now, examine the bottom transformations of the different object (a cake) to look for a similar pattern in terms of rotation:
   - In (A), the cake is shown from a front-facing perspective and then from a side perspective. This is not just rotation; the view shifts from one side of the cake to another, which is not the transformation shown with the walkie-talkie.

   - In (C), the cake starts from a front-facing perspective, then rotates to show a side perspective, and finally is shown from a top-down perspective, mimicking the sequence of rotation we saw with the walkie-talkie on top.

2. Now we examine each of the transformations at the bottom to determine which one matches this change:

    - (B) shows the character first facing the viewer and then the same character but smaller. This represents a change in size, not in orientation, and thus does not match the top transformation.
    - (C) depicts the character first facing the viewer and then the same character rotated to face away from us. The orientation change in (C) mirrors the transformation seen at the top with the rubber duck.

(A): Shows a figure facing forward, and then the next image shows the figure on its side, with all parts intact but reoriented. This does not match the transformation of the duck, which involves a part of the object being removed.

(B): Shows the figure fully intact in the first image, and then in the second image, the body of the figure is missing, only leaving the head and legs part, similar to how the duck is transformed from whole to a remaining head and tail part.

(C): Shows the figure in full in the first image, but in the second image there are multiple figures stacked in a structure.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle, and then compare it with the transformations of the objects at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation (Plane):
1. Orientation: The airplane on top starts facing right with the front of the plane pointing upwards and ends facing left with the front of the plane pointing downwards. There is a change in both orientation (flipped horizontally) and position (inverted vertically).

Now let's analyze the bottom transformations:

(A) Left Shoe Transformation:
1. Orientation: The shoe in (A) starts with the front pointing to the left and ends with the front pointing to the right. It's a simple rotation.
2. Position: The position remains unchanged. There's no flipping or inversion in the position of the shoe.

(B) Left Shoe Transformation:
1. Orientation: Similar to (A), the shoe in (B) starts with the front pointing left and ends with the front pointing right.
2. Position: The position remains the same as in (A).

(C) Left Shoe Transformation:
1. Orientation: The shoe starts with the toe pointing left and ends with the toe pointing right, just like (A) and (B).
2. Position: Unlike (A) and (B), the shoe in (C) is flipped horizontally and inverted vertically, similar to the airplane on top.

2. On the right side, we see only the silhouette of the elephant, and the silhouette is flipped horizontally (or mirrored).

Now let's examine the bottom row, looking for a transformation that matches the top row:

(A) shows a person likely snowboarding from one orientation to a different one while changing color.
(B) shows the same person snowboarding in a similar color and orientation, but the second image is a mirror image of the first, matching the flip seen in the top row.
(C) shows a similar person snowboarding with a color change and a rotation, but no flipping or mirroring.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Transformation on top: We see an elephant undergo a transformation where it becomes disassembled, with only the rear part (hind legs and tail) of its body remaining in the second image.
2. Option (A): The image starts with a snowboarder completely outfitted with gear and, in the second image, the snowboarder is still complete, no parts are missing or disassembled - this does not match the transformation on top.
3. Option (B): The first image shows a snowboarder upright and in the second image, the snowboarder is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This transformation involves a change in orientation – this does not match the transformation on top, which involves a disassembly, not merely a reorientation.
4. Option (C): The first image shows a complete snowboarder, and in the second image, the snowboarder's right arm appears to be removed or no longer visible. This indicates a kind of disassembly or subtraction, much like the transformation at the top where part of the elephant was removed.

While option (C) involves a change similar to the first transformation in that there is a removal or disappearance of a part, option (B) does not feature any parts being removed, the object simply being rotated; thus, despite the fact that option (C) technically involves disassembly whereas option (B) does not, neither of these options perfectly match the",1,2DRotation180

2. Compare this transformation with each of the transformations on the bottom (A, B, and C) of the snowmobile rider:
   - (A) shows a change in the snowmobile rider's orientation from upright to upside-down.
   - (B) shows a change from a detailed snowmobile rider to a silhouette without internal detail, closely matching the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a change in both the orientation and size of the snowmobile rider, as the image on the right is larger and rotated in comparison to the image on the left.

To solve this visual puzzle, we must examine the transformation that occurs with the character on the top row and then identify which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) of the object on the bottom row matches that transformation pattern.

1. The top row shows a character who undergoes a transformation from standing upright to hanging upside down. The change is in orientation - from normal standing position to inverted.

2. Now, looking at the transformations of the objects in the bottom row:
   - (A) depicts a snake moving from a coiled position to the same coiled orientation. There is no change in orientation or position, just a slight shift to the right.
   - (B) depicts a snake that is in a coiled position and then in an uncoiled position, but still maintains the same orientation relative to the ground. The change here is in the form of the snake, not orientation.
   - (C) depicts a snake that is in a coiled position and in the second image is also coiled but with the head pointing in the opposite direction. This is a change in orientation similar to the transformation seen with the character on the top row.

Given that we are looking for a match in the type of transformation and not the objects themselves, the correct answer is (C) because the orientation of the snake changes from the first to the second image, which is analogous to the character on the top row being right-side up in the first image",0,No change

1. In the sequence on the top, we have a character standing upright in the first image.
2. In the second image, the character is still upright but has undergone a change where parts of its body have been removed or are missing (specifically, the legs).
3. In the third image at the top, the character is upside down compared to its original position, with the previously missing legs returned but now sporting an accessory (glasses), which wasn't present initially.

Now, let's match this transformation with the options given below:

(A) The sequence starts with a full snake, then a snake with a bent form in the second image, and back to the full original snake in the third image. This option does not match the top sequence because nothing is added in the third step as it is in the top sequence.

(B) The sequence starts with a full snake, then a snake with a part of its body removed or missing (the loop is less pronounced) in the second image, and in the third image, there is a complete reversal of orientation with the previously missing body part (loop) returned. This matches the top sequence's pattern of loss and then return with an additional change (orientation flip).

1. The transformation on top shows an animated character increasing in size and flipping upside-down from left to right.

2. Looking at option (A), the object (a snake) remains the same in orientation and size from left to right, showing no transformation. Thus, this does not match the transformation on top.

3. Examining option (B), the snake changes in orientation (it flips to face the opposite direction) from left to right but does not change in size. This only partially matches the transformation on top as we're looking for both a size increase and an upside-down flip.

4. Finally, observing option (C), the snake increases in size and flips to an upside-down position from left to right. This exactly matches the transformation on top (an increase in size and an upside-down flip).

4. Option (C) shows a frog where the second image is a mirrored version of the first. While there is a change in the orientation, there is no increase in openness.

   - In (B), the frog is not only rotating but also transitioning from sitting to standing. This adds an extra transformation that is not seen in the top transformation.

   - In (C), there are multiple changes: the frog rotates, changes orientation significantly by flipping upside down, and also changes in the number of visible limbs. This is more complex than just an orientation change.

1. Looking at the top transformation, we see a house that rotates 180 degrees from left to right. The first image of the house is upright, and the second image is upside-down.

2. Now examining option (A), the character rotates but also changes orientation from facing forward to facing backward. This is not the same as the house transformation.

3. Option (B) shows the character rotating 180 degrees without any other change, which now presents the character upside-down in the same orientation.

4. Finally, option (C) shows the character being duplicated and rotated, which is different from the single object transformation seen in the top row.

The transformation that matches the top row is, therefore, the one in option (B), where the single character is rotated 180 degrees to appear upside-down.",0,2DRotation+90

- For (A), the character remains in the same orientation and position. There is no transformation.
- For (B), the character rotates 180 degrees around its vertical axis from the first to the second image, similarly to the transformation of the barn on top of the puzzle.
- For (C), the character not only rotates 180 degrees around its vertical axis but also switches its front and back, which means the character has undergone a more complex transformation than the one portrayed in the top sequence.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because it mirrors the top transformation of the barn, which involves a simple 180-degree vertical axis rotation.",0,2DRotation+90

  (B) In this transformation, the teapot is turned upside-down from left to right, which matches the orientation change seen with the bicycle on the top.

  (C) In this transformation, the teapot rotates sideways; the handle moves from the left to the right side. This isn't inverting the orientation fully like flipping it upside-down; it's merely a rotation.

Therefore, the transformation that is the same for the object on the bottom as for the bicycle on the top is (B), where the teapot is flipped upside down from left to right.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Transformation on Top: The top transformation shows an upright bicycle becoming inverted while maintaining its size, color, and number. It is a change in orientation.

2. Option (A): Shows a transformation of a turkey-like figure from facing left to facing right. This is a change in orientation similar to the bicycle, but the figure also increases in size, which introduces another variable. Therefore, this is not the same transformation.

3. Option (B): Here the transformation of the turkey figure is from facing left to facing left, maintaining its size and color but with a change in orientation. However, the second image is a mirror image of the first (flipped along the vertical axis), which is different from merely inverting the object like the bicycle at the top.

4. Option (C): Shows a turkey figure facing left, and in the next image, the figure is upside down, maintaining its size, color, and number like the bicycle. This is a change in orientation and matches the transformation seen at the top.

1. The transformation that occurs from left to right in the top row involves the object (a cheese grater) flipping horizontally to change its orientation from facing upwards to facing downwards.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C), we must identify which transformation most closely matches the top transformation:

   - (A) shows a flower and the transformation involves rotating the flower. The flower in the first box faces left, and in the second box, it faces right. This is not the same transformation as the one in the top row.

   - (B) shows a flower and the transformation involves changing the orientation of the entire flower. The flower in the first box has its petals facing up, and in the second box, the petals are facing down. This matches the top row's transformation where the entire object flips.

Now let's analyze the transformations of the objects marked by (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

(A) The flower rotates and one leaf changes its position, but the number of petals on the flower and leaves also changes, which is not a characteristic observed in the transformation of the object on top.

(B) The flower rotates from the first to the second position. There are no changes in size, color, number of petals, or leaves of the flower. This matches the transformation seen with the cheese grater on top where only rotation occurs.

(C) The flower rotates and the number of leaves increases from the first to the second position. This introduces a change in number, which was not present in the top transformation.

  - (C) shows a flower where the second image is both flipped (vertically rotated) and reduced in size, which is not the same as the top transformation because the top transformation involves only a rotation, not a change in size.

Given the above examination, (B) is the transformation that matches the top sequence because it involves the same type of rotation transformation without changes in size, number, or color.",1,2DRotation180

2. Let's analyze the bottom transformations to see which matches the pattern of the top transformation:
   - (A) displays three identical images with no change, thus no transformation is occurring.
   - (B) displays a change in orientation but in a different manner. The left-to-right transformation involves flipping the object (a bowl of ice cream) onto its side and then upside down, but this is a flip or a tumble, not a simple rotation.

1. We'll start with the transformation at the top with the figure of the rabbit on a green mat. The transformation from the first image to the second one does not change the rabbit itself; instead, it changes the orientation of the rabbit. The rabbit is turned upside-down while the green mat it is sitting on remains in the same place, suggesting that it is only the orientation of the rabbit that is changing, not its position relative to the green mat.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom:
   - Option (A) shows three images of what appears to be ice cream with different scoops. From left to right, the images remain unchanged. There is no transformation in size, orientation, number, or color. Thus, this sequence does not match the top transformation where the orientation changes.
   - Option (B) shows three images of the ice cream where, from left to right, the orientation of the ice cream changes. The third image is a top-down view, which means the ice cream has been rotated similar to how the rabbit is upside-down in the top transformation. There are no changes in size, number, or color.

2. Option (A): The donut is rotated slightly to the right. This is a simple rotation in the plane of the image and does not represent a change in the viewpoint from above to below, so this is not the same transformation.

3. Option (B): The donut is flipped upside down. This is similar to the transformation applied to the rabbit where the viewpoint changes from one side to the other (from above to below), representing a rotation along the horizontal axis.

4. Option (C): The donut remains right side up and identical in orientation in both images; hence, it does not match the transformation applied to the rabbit.

    - Option (B): The cat rotates 90 degrees clockwise from the first image to the second, matching the transformation observed with the rooster.
    - Option (C): The cat increases in size from the first to the second image; this is a change in size, not in orientation.

The top transformation of the image features a rooster which is changing its orientation. In the first image, the rooster is oriented to the left, and in the second image, the rooster is oriented to the right. No other changes such as size, color, or number are evident in this transformation.

Now, let's look at the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle:

(A) shows a cat oriented to the viewer's left in the first image and upside down in the second image. This is a change in orientation but also includes flipping over vertically, which doesn't match the type of change seen in the rooster's transformation.

(B) shows a cat facing left in the first image and facing right in the second image. This change matches the rooster's change as it only involves an orientation change.

(C) shows a cat that is oriented to the viewer's left in the first image and lies on the back on the second image. This is again a change in orientation but also includes flipping over horizontally, which doesn't align with the transformation of the rooster.

Since the transformation we're looking to match involves only a change in orientation without any flips, (B) is the one that corresponds to the transformation seen at the top with the rooster.",0,No change

Looking at the top transformation:
1. The rooster is seen from its left side in the first image.
2. In the second image, the rooster is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise and is seen more from the back, with its head turned to the right.

Now, comparing the transformations on the bottom:
- (A): The cat is initially viewed slightly from the front and is then rotated to be seen more from the side. This does not match the rooster's rotation.
- (B): The cat's orientation remains mostly unchanged from the first image to the second image, so this does not match either.
- (C): The cat is first seen from the side and in the second image is rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise and is seen more from the top, with its head turned to the left.

The transformation seen in (C) matches the rooster's transformation at the top of the puzzle: a 90-degree rotation with a change in the perspective from which the head is seen. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",1,2DRotation180

2. Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom:

   - Transformation (A) shows an office chair. From left to right, the chair is first upright, then flipped upside down, and lastly, it shows only the back of the chair with the rest of the chair missing. This transformation involves flipping and removal of parts.

   - Transformation (C) shows the chair becoming progressively smaller in size from left to right. This transformation involves a change in size, which is different from the transformation at the top.

1. In the top puzzle, we see a left-to-right transformation of an object which is a dumbbell. This transformation shows a change in orientation; the dumbbell is first shown from a side perspective and then from a frontal perspective.

2. Looking at option (A): the transformation of the chair involves a change in orientation (the chair is being tipped over) and a change in perspective (viewing angle from the side to more from the top). This is not identical to the transformation on top.

3. Looking at option (B): the change here involves only a change in orientation; the chair is shown from a side perspective and then from a frontal perspective. This is similar to the transformation of the dumbbell on top.

37,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top of the puzzle involves an object (a toy duck on wheels) that undergoes a change in orientation from upright to upside-down from the first to the second image. Additionally, there is a change in detail, where the number ""2"" changes to the letter ""z"".

2. Now let's analyze the three bottom transformations to find a similar pattern:

- (A) shows a giraffe that is upright in the first image and then upside-down in the second image. This is an orientation change that is consistent with the top transformation.

- (B) shows a giraffe that is upright in both images. There's no change in orientation here, so this cannot be the correct transformation that matches the one at the top.

- (C) shows a giraffe that is upright in the first image and upside-down in the second. While this represents a change in orientation, there is also a change in position, as the giraffe is not only upside-down but also angled differently. This change in position is different from the simple upside-down orientation change in the toy duck transformation at the top.

3. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer, as both the toy duck and the giraffe in (A) simply go from an upright orientation to an upside-down orientation without additional positional changes, and also display a change in detail (number to a letter, and spots changing shape respectively).",1,2DRotation180

- We need to find a similar transformation among the three sets of guitars marked (A), (B), and (C).

Looking at each option:
- (A) shows two guitars that are identical; there's no transformation at all.
- (B) shows the guitar rotating, but it's a 180-degree flip, not a 90-degree rotation.
- (C) shows the guitar rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is the same type of transformation that the kayak underwent.

The transformation shown at the top is of a kayak. The change from the first kayak to the second kayak is a rotation, such that the second kayak appears to have been rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise relative to the first.

Now, let's analyze each of the bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C) step by step to find the one that matches the top transformation:

- (A) shows two images of a guitar. The guitar appears to be rotated in a similar fashion to the kayak — the second guitar has been rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise relative to the first guitar. This matches the transformation seen with the kayak.
- (B) shows a guitar that changes its orientation slightly but remains mostly in an upright position, similar to the first image. There is no significant rotation between the first and the second images. This does not match the transformation of the kayak.
- (C) displays a significant rotation; however, the rotation here is more than 90 degrees, and the guitar in the second image is flipped upside down compared to the first, which is a different transformation from the one on the top.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Let's first identify the transformation that occurs in the top part of the puzzle with the kayak:
   - The kayak is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the first image to the second image.

2. Next, we examine each of the bottom transformations to identify which object transformation matches the transformation of the kayak on top:
   - Option (A): The guitar is not rotated; instead, it changes its position within the frame, but maintains the same orientation.
   - Option (B): The guitar is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, similar to the kayak's transformation on top.
   - Option (C): The guitar remains in the same orientation and a second, identical guitar appears beside it, thus increasing the number of objects.

1. Look at the top transformation of the butterfly:
   - The butterfly is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise from the first to the second image.

2. Compare this transformation to those of the object (a fox) in the bottom three transformations (A), (B), and (C):

   - (A) shows the fox changing orientation from upright to being on its back with a flip around its horizontal axis.
   - (B) shows the fox rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise, similar to the top transformation of the butterfly.
   - (C) shows no transformation; the fox remains in the same position and orientation.

3. The transformation in (B) with the fox matches the transformation at the top with the butterfly, which is a rotation of the whole object approximately 90 degrees clockwise.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation of the butterfly shows a change in orientation. The butterfly starts with its wings spread out, and as it moves from left to right, it rotates to show a side view where the wings appear vertically aligned.

   - (A) shows a change in scale. The fox remains oriented in the same direction but reduces in size from left to right.
   - (B) shows a change in orientation. The fox starts sitting upright and rotates to lay down with its underside visible.
   - (C) shows multiple transformations. The fox doesn't only change in orientation but also appears to be partially disassembled or transformed into a different shape altogether.

39,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Top Transformation (Butterfly)
   - In the top row, we see a butterfly.
   - In the first image, the butterfly is upright.
   - In the second image, the butterfly is still upright, but its wings have closed up, making it appear more narrow.
   - In the third image, the butterfly is rotated to its side and appears to have one wing overlapping the other.

2. Bottom Transformations (Three Options)
   - We need to compare each sequence with the transformation pattern observed in the butterfly sequence.

   (A) The sequence shows a fox in the first two images with no apparent change, and in the third image, the fox is broken apart, which is not analogous to any change in the butterfly's sequence.

   (B) The sequence begins with a fox upright. In the second image, the fox is still upright but has become more narrow due to one of its legs being lifted, similar to the butterfly's wings closing. In the third image, the fox is on its back with its legs in the air, resembling the side rotation and overlapping wing of the butterfly in the top sequence.

   (C) This sequence portrays a fox upright in the first image, broken apart in the second, and even more scattered in the third. This does not follow the pattern of the butterfly's changes.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we see an object that rotates 45 degrees clockwise from left to right. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects; the only change is in orientation.

2. Now let's look at the transformations on the bottom:

   - (A) shows a sub sandwich, which also rotates, but it rotates 90 degrees clockwise rather than 45 degrees.
   - (B) shows the sub sandwich rotating counterclockwise, which is not the same direction of rotation as the top transformation.
   - (C) shows the sub sandwich rotating 45 degrees clockwise from left to right, which mirrors the transformation of the object on the top.

The transformation seems to involve rotation or a change in orientation. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Observe the top transformation sequence, which features a claw-like object that appears to rotate or change its orientation between the two stages. It maintains the same shape and color but is simply flipped horizontally.

2. Now, look at the three sequences below:
   - Examination of (A) reveals that the first sandwich is flipped horizontally to achieve the appearance of the second sandwich, mirroring the type of action seen in the top sequence. 

   - Examination of (B) reveals that there is no change in orientation or flipping; instead, the sandwich is merely shifted to the left within the frame.

   - Examination of (C) shows that the first sandwich is replicated, resulting in two sandwiches in the second image without changing the orientation of the original.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it features the same type of change or action—a horizontal flip or a change in orientation—as the transformation on the top with the claw-like object.",0,2DRotation+90
40,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, we see a transformation where a composite object seems to split into its components. The left side shows a combined object, and the right side shows the object decomposed into separate parts with each part slightly smaller than the original combined size.

2. On the bottom of the puzzle, we need to find a transformation that follows a similar pattern.

3. Looking at option (A), there is no transformation; both images on the left and right are identical, so this is not the correct answer.

4. Option (B) shows a whole sandwich on the left and the right shows the same sandwich but deconstructed with each part (bread, lettuce, salami, cheese) separated from each other. This is the same type of transformation as seen in the top transformation - a whole object decomposing into its separate components. Each part also appears slightly smaller, as was the case with the top puzzle.

5. Option (C) shows a whole sandwich on the left which is then tilted in the version on the right. This transformation involves a change in orientation, not in decomposition into components.

Therefore, the transformation sequence that matches the top of the puzzle is (B) because it showcases an object (the sandwich) becoming decomposed into its separated components, which is analogous to the top transformation.",0,2DRotation+90

1. Examine the top transformation:

   - The object (a bug) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the first image to the second image. This matches the transformation observed in the top example.

4. Compare to option (C):

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation observed at the top of the puzzle and then compare it to the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle.

Top of the puzzle transformation: 
- The object (a red and green abstract item that looks like a backpack with facial features) is rotating as it moves from left to right. It starts facing forward and ends facing backward, which is a rotation of 180 degrees around the vertical axis.

Now let's analyze the bottom transformations:

(A) This shows a red and green fly-like insect that rotates as it goes from the left image to the center image and then from the center image to the right image. The orientation of the insect changes in each image, it begins facing left, then faces upward, and finally faces right. The pattern of rotation maintains the same amount of turn between each image and the position of the legs, wings, and eyes corroborate a consistent rotational movement. 

(B) The insect also rotates from the left to the right, but the change isn't consistent between each image. It starts facing left, then faces directly upward, and finally, it faces downward a bit to the left. The pattern of rotation is inconsistent as the axis of rotation changes from one image to the next, which is not in line with the transformation at the top of the puzzle where the item rotates consistently around the same vertical axis.

(C) In this option, the insect rotates",1,2DRotation180
41,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning for choosing (B):

1. The top transformation shows a backpack that changes its orientation from vertical to horizontal while also changing its color from predominantly green in the left image to predominantly red in the right image.

2. We will compare the two traits changed in the top transformation (change in orientation and color) with the transformations at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C).

3. Transformation (A) shows a change in orientation from facing left in the first image to facing upwards in the second image. There is no change in color as the bug remains predominantly red with a green-striped backpack in both images, so (A) is not the correct transformation that matches the top one.

4. Transformation (B) shows a change in the orientation of the bug, from facing left to facing right, and also a change in color, as the bug's backpack changes from half green and half red in the left image to entirely red in the right image. These changes in orientation and color match the changes in the top transformation.

5. Transformation (C) changes the orientation of the bug from facing left in the first image to facing right in the second image, similar to (B); however, the color does not change between the two images as it remains red with a green-striped backpack, so the transformation does not match the top transformation entirely.

   - (A) shows a cluster of flowers that rotate clockwise and get smaller from left to right.
   - (B) shows a cluster of flowers that rotate counterclockwise and get larger from left to right.
   - (C) shows a cluster of flowers that lose some flowers and foliage, reducing in number from left to right.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at this conclusion:

   - The croissant is rotating clockwise from left to right.

2. Now let's look at the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle marked by (A), (B), and (C) to see which matches the transformation of the croissant:
   - (A) The bunch of flowers is changing in orientation but the change is not a simple rotation; the flowers appear to get flipped and rearranged, rather than just rotated.
   - (B) The bunch of flowers rotates clockwise from left to right, which is the same type of transformation observed in the croissant.
   - (C) There are two changes happening here: one is a rotation similar to (B), but there's also a change in the number of visible flowers, which does not match the simple rotation observed in the croissant.

To solve this puzzle, let's look at the top transformation and determine what changes are occurring between the left and the right object. Then we will compare these changes to the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

Top Transformation Analysis:
1. The left shows a singular croissant with the curve opening to the left.
2. The right shows the croissant transformed into what appears as two croissants joined together at the ends with the curves facing opposite directions, implying an increase in number from one to two and a rotational reflection.

Bottom Transformation Analysis:
(A) The left shows a bunch of flowers. The right shows the flowers, but they seem twisted or rotated somehow, without an increase in number or joining together.
(B) The left shows one bunch of flowers. The right shows a similar transformation to what we see in the top transformation: the flowers increased in number (from one bunch to two) and are rotated in a mirrored fashion like the croissants.
(C) The left shows one bunch of flowers. The right shows the same bunch but rotated, without an increase in number or a mirrored effect.

From this analysis, the transformation in (B) matches the transformation at the top because it involves both an increase in the number of objects and a mirrored rotation, just like the transformation from a single croissant to two mirrored croissants. Hence, the correct answer is (B).",0,No change

3. Option (B) shows the gingerbread man going from a standing position to lying flat, mirroring the orientation change of the dinosaur on the top. This is similar to the dinosaur's transformation.

4. Option (C) shows the gingerbread man rotated but then also flipped onto its back, which involves an additional transformation (flipping) that does not occur in the top transformation.

   - Option (B) shows the gingerbread man being flipped from facing left to facing right, which is the same type of transformation observed in the top example with the dinosaur.
   - Option (C) shows the gingerbread man being rotated but not flipped; it's facing the same direction in both images, just rotated to a different orientation.

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to examine and compare the transformation that occurs in the top sequence with the transformations presented in (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom.

The transformation of the object on top (the red mug) can be described as follows:

1. In the first image, we see a red mug with designs on it and its handle oriented to the left.

A. The pig is rotated from being on all fours to sitting upright.
B. The pig is rotated from facing left to facing right, while staying on all fours.
C. The pig is rotated, but this time it is also slightly scaled down in size.

- In option (B), the pig remains on all fours, but the perspective shifts, showing the pig more from the front in the second image. Although it's also a change in orientation, it's not quite the same as the change seen with the mug.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's compare the transformation of the object on the top row (the mug) with each of the transformations of the object on the bottom row (the pigs). We're looking for a matching transformation in terms of size, orientation, number, or color.

For the mug on the top:
- The transformation is rotational. The mug on the right has been rotated relative to the mug on the left. The key characteristic of this transformation is the change in orientation. The size, color, and number of mugs remain the same.

Now let's apply this to the bottom row:

Option (A):
- The first pig is on its feet, and the second pig is also on its feet but has been flipped over to its left side. This does not match the rotational transformation seen with the mug because the second pig has been reflected, not rotated.

Option (B):
- The first pig is on its feet, while the second pig has rotated and is now facing upwards with its underside visible. This is the correct match as it represents a rotational transformation, just like the mug.

Option (C):
- The first pig is on its feet, and the second pig has been slightly rotated to the left but is still mainly oriented the same way as the first pig. While there is a slight rotation, it does not match the more substantial rotational transformation shown with the mug.

(C) Shows a snowman-like figure that first appears upright, then splits into two separate figures—one gray and one slightly transparent—and finally reunites into one upright figure. This set of transformations involves a change in the number and transparency of the figures, which does not match the top transformation that solely involves orientation.

- Transformation (B) shows the same chess piece being flipped upside-down from the first to the second image. This means it is rotated by 180 degrees about a horizontal axis, similar to the character's rotation at the top.
- Transformation (C) shows the chess piece being scaled up or increased in size from the first to the second image—no rotation or flipping occurs here.

By comparing these transformations with the character's transformation at the top, we find that only transformation (B) matches the type of transformation seen with the character: a rotation of 180 degrees about a horizontal axis.",0,No change
47,0,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- The transformation in the top row involves a cabinet that is going from a closed to an open position. This is a change in orientation from closed (left) to open (right).

- Now let's examine the transformations in the lower row:
  - (A) shows a plush toy that is initially sitting (left) and then falls backward onto its back with its feet and arms in the air (right), which is a change in orientation but not in a similar manner to the top transformation.
  - (B) shows a plush toy that is initially sitting (left) and then flips upside-down (right), which is another change in orientation, but again not analogous to the opening door at the top.
  - (C) shows a plush toy that is initially sitting and facing forward (left) and then changes position to facing towards the left side (right). This is the only transformation in which the orientation change is similar to the top row's cabinet door opening. It is a rotational change in viewpoint, just like the cabinet's door opening.

The transformation of the plush toy in (C) mirrors the opening aspect of the cabinet's door, making (C) the correct transformation matching the change in orientation seen in the top row.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the top of the puzzle, we see a transformation of a cabinet. The cabinet goes from being closed on the left to partially open in the middle and fully open on the right. The transformation here involves a change in the orientation or position of the cabinet doors.

2. Now let's examine the bottom transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C):

- (A) shows a teddy bear going from sitting up to laying on its back and then on its side. This is a change in the orientation or position, similar to the cabinet, but not the same sequence of movements.
  
- (B) also shows a change in the teddy bear's orientation: from sitting up to leaning back with feet up, and then sitting up again but now facing in the opposite direction. This sequence of movements matches the cabinet's top transformation in terms of opening up and then revealing a different side/facet while returning to a position reminiscent of the initial state.

- (C) shows the teddy bear going from sitting up to being upside down, which is not the same kind of transformation as the cabinet's movement.

3. The sequence that matches most closely with the top transformation is (B) because it involves a similar change in orientation, leading to a different presentation of the object while returning to a similar initial form.",0,No change
47,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

Top Transformation (Cupboard):
1. The first image shows a closed, upright cupboard.
2. The second image shows the cupboard slightly open.
3. The third image shows the cupboard fully open.

We are observing a transformation involving the change in the orientation and state of the cupboard from closed to open.

Option (A):
1. The first image shows a teddy bear in a sitting position facing forward.
2. The second image shows the same teddy bear lying on its side.

This option involves a change in orientation but not in the state of an object being opened.

Option (B):
1. The first image shows the teddy bear in a sitting position facing forward.
2. The second image shows the teddy bear in the same sitting position but slightly leaned back.

This option involves a slight change in orientation but does not show an opening motion or transition.

Option (C):
1. The first image shows the teddy bear in a sitting position facing forward.
2. The second image shows the teddy bear in the same sitting position but with its arms and legs wider apart.
3. The third image further shows the teddy bear with its arms and legs even more widely stretched out.

This sequence mimics the opening transformation seen in the cupboard, with the arms and legs of the teddy bear analogously representing the doors of the cupboard opening up. There is a progressive change in the orientation/state of the ted",1,2DRotation180
48,0,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Look at the top transformation: The object, which is a submarine, is rotating around its center from left to right. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects. It's simply a rotation of the object in place.

Let's analyze the transformations on the bottom row:

(A) The fish turns slightly towards us but doesn't undergo the same central axis rotation as the submarine.
(B) The fish rotates around its center from left to right. This mirrors the transformation of the submarine at the top.
(C) The fish rotates but also changes its orientation from facing left to facing right, which is not the same transformation as seen with the submarine.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top one is (B) where the fish completes a similar central axis rotation without any other changes.",0,No change
48,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation: it shows a horizontal object (a submarine) that rotates to a vertical orientation.

2. Now examine the bottom transformations marked with (A), (B), and (C) to find a match:

   - Transformation (A) changes the orientation of the fish slightly, but the fish is still predominantly horizontal, and it doesn't match the top orientation change which is 90 degrees vertical.
   - Transformation (B) shows the fish in a horizontal orientation and then in a vertical orientation, which is exactly the same type of change as in the top transformation (a 90-degree rotation).
   - Transformation (C) also rotates the fish, but the fish ends up facing the opposite direction from the start, which is different from the simple 90-degree rotation shown in the top transformation.

Therefore, the transformation sequence in (B) is the same as the transformation on the top of the puzzle: a change in orientation from horizontal to vertical.",0,No change
48,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The top transformation shows a submarine that rotates 180 degrees from left to right but retains its color and size.
- Now, looking at the bottom transformations:
- Option (A) shows a fish that flips vertically from left to right but also changes its orientation from facing up to facing down.
- Option (B) shows a fish that rotates 180 degrees horizontally, just like the submarine in the top transformation, without any other changes.
- Option (C) shows a fish that seems to flip vertically and slightly changes its orientation in relation to the ""camera"" perspective.

Option (B) matches the transformation seen at the top, which is a simple 180-degree rotation with no other changes to the object's color or size.",0,2DRotation+90
49,0,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we observe a ship undergoing a change in orientation from a side view in the first image to a top-down view in the second.

2. Now we look at the transformations under (A), (B), and (C) to determine which one involves the same type of change.

3. Transformation (A) shows no change between the two objects; they appear to be the same satellite dish in the same orientation.

4. Transformation (B) shows a satellite dish changing from a side view to a top-down view which mirrors the change in orientation seen in the top transformation.

5. Transformation (C) involves a change in orientation as well, but from a side/front view to a side angled slightly upwards.

6. We can conclude that option (B) is the correct answer because it matches the type of change in the top transformation: a change in orientation from a side view to a top-down view.",0,2DRotation+90
49,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the top of the puzzle, we see a ship that is undergoing a transformation from left to right. It starts as a complete ship and becomes partially submerged and capsized by the third frame. The transformation involves a change in orientation with an implication of sinking.

2. Option (A) shows a knob that remains upright and unchanged in orientation in all three frames. There is no analogous transformation related to what is depicted at the top. Hence, (A) is not the correct answer.

3. Option (B) shows the knob in an upright position in the first frame, tilting in the second frame, and completely inverted in the third frame. This reflects a change in orientation similar to the capsizing of the ship at the top of the puzzle.

4. Option (C) shows the knob in an upright position in the first frame and then it merely moves closer without changing its orientation or implied physical state in the subsequent frames. Therefore, (C) does not match the transformation shown at the top.

Given that option (B) is the only sequence that shows a change in orientation analogous to the ship's transformation, it is the correct choice.",1,2DRotation180
49,2,0,180,0,180,+90,0,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to discern the transformation process applied to the objects in the sequence given at the top and then match it to the process applied to one of the sequences labeled (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom.

For the top sequence, the change from the first to the second image is a 90-degree rotation along the vertical axis. The change to the third image is a continuation of that rotation for another 90 degrees in the same direction, resulting in the object turning a total of 180 degrees around its vertical axis from the first image to the last. 

Now, we compare this process with each of the three options at the bottom:

- Option (A) shows the object rotated around a horizontal axis, rather than a vertical one.
- Option (B) shows the object turning around its vertical axis, just like the top sequence.
- Option (C) also shows rotation, but the direction of rotation from the second to the third object is reversed compared to the rotation from the first to the second object.

As option (B) follows the same transformation process as the top sequence, it is the correct answer.",1,2DRotation180
