To deduce the correct answer, let's analyze the transformation that occurs with the dog images at the top of the puzzle, then compare it to the transformations of the object at the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C).

The dog images show a left-to-right transformation that involves a change in orientation. The dog on the left is standing on all four legs, while the dog on the right is lying on its back with its legs in the air.

Now let's examine each of the sequences at the bottom:

(A) The object rotates slightly counter-clockwise from left to right.
(B) The object appears to flip vertically from left to right, similar to the dog's transformation from standing to lying on its back.
(C) The object remains upright but shifts its orientation from pointing left to pointing right.

From this analysis, we can see that the transformation depicted in (B) mirrors the top transformation with the dog: in both cases, there is a vertical flip in orientation. Option (A) is a simple rotation without flipping, and option (C) is a horizontal pivot without flipping, so neither of these matches the top transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",1,2DRotation-90
0,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top transformation of the dog, we see that its orientation changes from facing left to facing right relative to its initial position. The dog is rotating along its vertical axis.

- Now examining the transformations on the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C):
  - In (A), there is no rotation or flipping; both submarines are facing the same direction.
  - In (B), the submarine rotates along its vertical axis, changing its orientation from facing left to facing right, similar to the transformation of the dog on the top.
  - In (C), the submarine undergoes a change in size rather than an orientation change.

Therefore, transformation (B) mirrors the transformation on the top, where the object is rotated along its vertical axis to face the opposite direction.",1,2DRotation-90
0,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

Here is a step-by-step reasoning for choosing option (B):

1. The top transformation shows a dog changing its orientation between the first and second frame. In the first frame, the dog is upright and facing to the left. In the second frame, the dog is rotated and facing downward.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
   a. (A) shows a submarine maintaining the same orientation but changes size, becoming smaller from left to right.
   b. (B) shows a submarine that changes orientation between the first and second frame. In the first frame, the submarine is horizontal and facing to the right, while in the second frame, it is vertical and facing upward.
   c. (C) shows a submarine moving from left to right, maintaining its size, orientation, and shape.

3. Based on these observations, the process of elimination states that (A) is incorrect because the size changes rather than orientation, and (C) is incorrect because there is no change at all.

4. Option (B) is the correct choice as it represents the same type of change as the one on top: a change in the object's orientation without altering its size, color, or number.",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Top Transformation: The object (a desk fan) is being rotated counter-clockwise from an upright position to a sideways position. There is no change in size, number, or color of the fan.
2. Option (A) Transformation: The object (fries in a container) falls over onto its side from an upright position. This is similar to the top transformation regarding the change in orientation. However, the fries also splay outwards in the second image, which did not occur in the top transformation.
3. Option (B) Transformation: The fries container tilts and some fries fall out. The container's position changes in a manner very similar to the fan on the top - from upright to sideways - and the number of visible fries decreases due to some falling out, mirroring the removal of part of the fan's stand in the top transformation.
4. Option (C) Transformation: The object remains upright, but the fries increase in number. This transformation involves a change in number but doesn’t match the rotation seen in the top transformation.

Option (B) most closely mirrors the top transformation by changing the orientation of the object from upright to sideways and slightly reducing the complexity or components of the object (the stand of the fan is not visible in the rotated position, similar to some fries falling out of the container).",1,2DRotation-90
1,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top transformation, the object (a desk fan) rotates clockwise. From its initial position, we see the front of the fan, and in the transformed position, we see the back of the fan.

- Now let’s examine the transformations on the bottom:

(A) The fries box is rotated in such a manner that from its initial front view, we now see a side view. It seems like a rotation to the right when viewed from top, but it's not a complete 180-degree flip like the fan's transformation.

(B) The fries box shows its front view in the first image and in the second image it is rotated 180 degrees to show the backside of the box, much like the fan in the top transformation.

(C) The fries box starts with a front view and transitions to a tilted top view. This is not similar to the transformation seen with the fan.

Since option (B) matches the top transformation—a 180-degree rotation to reveal the backside—the correct answer is indeed (B).",0,No change

To solve this visual puzzle, let's look at the transformation that occurs at the top of the puzzle with the fan and then compare it to the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation: The electric fan is shown in two stages. In the first stage, the fan is upright and facing to the left, and in the second stage, the fan is tilted and facing downward. There is no change in size, number, or color; only the orientation changes.

Now, let's analyze the transformations on the bottom:

(A) The container of fries is shown standing upright in the first image, and the second shows the container lying on its side, spilling the fries out. The transformation involves a change in orientation, similar to the top transformation with the fan, but with no change in size, number, or color.

(B) The first image shows the fries upright in their container, and the second shows the fries without their container, turned upside down. This not only represents a change in orientation but also a change in the presentation (container vs. no container), which is not present in the top transformation.

(C) Here, two images are presented, both with the fries upright in their container, with no change in orientation, size, color, or number.

Since option (A) is the only one that represents a similar transformation to that which occurred at the top—an unchanged size, color, number, and a change in orientation—the correct answer is",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the visual puzzle, the transformation of the rocking horse involves a change in orientation. The horse is initially in a normal upright position, and in the next image, it is flipped upside-down.

2. We need to determine which of the bottom transformations (A), (B), or (C) matches this change in orientation.

3. Looking at option (A), the transformation of the object appears to be a change in perspective or viewing angle rather than a change in orientation; the object is not upside-down in the second image.

4. In option (B), the object is rotated in a way that changes the orientation in the same manner as the rocking horse in the top puzzle—it ends upside-down in the second image.

5. Option (C) shows the same object without any change between the two images; there is neither a change in orientation, size, number, nor color.

6. Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top is (B), where the change involves flipping the object upside-down.",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the transformation of the object on top, we can see that it is a rocking horse that has flipped over from the left image to the right image. This is a change in orientation.

2. Now, examining the three transformations on the bottom, we evaluate them based on the type of transformation:

   - (A) shows a character in a space helmet oriented upright in the left image and then rotated to the right in the right image. This is a rotational transformation, not a flipping over.
   
   - (B) shows the same character in a space helmet oriented upright in the left image and then upside down in the right image. This matches the flipping over transformation seen in the top pair, which suggests that the orientation has been inverted, similar to the rocking horse.
   
   - (C) shows the character oriented upright in both the left and right images, so there is no change in orientation or any other visible transformation.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top of the puzzle is (B), where the object (the character in the space helmet) has been flipped over from the first to the second image, same as the rocking horse on top.",1,2DRotation-90
2,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The transformation at the top shows a rocking horse that is initially upright and then flipped over to a resting position on its side, which is a change in orientation.
2. Option (A) shows the object rotating slightly to the right, which is not the same as flipping over.
3. Option (B) shows a similar transformation to the top image, where the object is initially upright and then flipped over to a resting position on its side. The change in orientation and the resting position are analogous to the transformation of the rocking horse at the top.
4. Option (C) shows the object rotating slightly to the left, which, like (A), is not a flip to a resting position.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the top object and then compare it to the transformations of the bottom objects marked with (A), (B), and (C).

Transformation on Top:
- The top transformation involves a change in size and orientation. The object on the left is larger and rotated to the left compared to the object on the right, which is smaller and rotated to the right.

Now, I will compare this transformation with each of the bottom options:

(A) The object on the left is larger and facing to the left, and the object on the right is smaller and facing toward the right.
(B) The object on the left has both eyes open and is larger, whereas the object on the right has one eye closed (changes in features other than size, orientation, or color), and it's also smaller.
(C) The object on the left has an open mouth, while the object on the right has a closed mouth (this also is a change in features not consistent with the transformation on the top).

The correct answer is (A) because it is the only bottom transformation that involves a change in size and orientation without any change in object features, which matches the transformation observed on the top.",1,2DRotation-90
3,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation seems to be a change in orientation of an abstract object. It rotates from a side view to a top-down view as we move from left to right.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows no actual transformation, the object remains in the same position and orientation in all three frames.
   - (B) shows a change in the part of the object that is visible, as if the object is rotating on an axis, yet the object itself does not change its orientation regarding the viewer's perspective – the eye is always visible in the same manner.
   - (C) shows a true change in orientation relative to the viewer's perspective. The first image shows the object's side view, the middle image shows a slightly rotated version, and the third image shows the object from what appears to be a top-down view.

3. Since the top transformation involves a change in orientation to a top-down view, we look for the series of images that similarly changes from a side view to a top-down view.

Option (C) is the only sequence that mimics this transformation seen at the top, with the object rotating to present different views from left to right, culminating in a top-down perspective.",0,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The top transformation shows molecule-like structures that change in orientation from the first to the second image.
2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
- (A) shows no changes between the two states; the object's orientation and appearance remain consistent.
- (B) displays a rotation or turning of the object, similar to the top transformation, where the object is viewed from a different angle in the second image.
- (C) shows a change in the object where additional features (ears) appear, which is not merely an orientation change; it is adding new elements.

3. Since the rotation or change in orientation aligns with the change observed in the top transformation, the correct answer is (B), as it is the only one that exhibits an analogous change solely in the orientation of the object without adding or removing parts.",1,2DRotation-90

3. Option (B) doesn't match the transformation observed on the top because it shows the grape bunch rotating slighty but also changing in perspective; as the stems that were pointing upwards are now pointing downwards. This adds an extra transformation element not seen in the top example.

4. Option (C) is also incorrect because it exhibits a rotation that flips the grapes upside down, which is a different kind of rotation from what is shown in the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the top transformation, we see a grayscale image of a ship on the left that becomes a colored image on the right. This indicates a transformation from grayscale to color.

2. Now, we need to find a similar transformation among the three bottom options.

- Option (A) shows a cluster of grapes with a leaf on the left side, and on the right side, the cluster of grapes is shown without a leaf. The transformation here is the removal of an element (the leaf), not a change from grayscale to color.
- Option (B) shows a cluster of grapes with a leaf on the left side and on the right side, the same cluster is shown with a bigger leaf. This transformation involves the change in size of an element (the leaf), not a change from grayscale to color.
- Option (C) shows a cluster of grapes with a leaf in grayscale on the left side and the same cluster in color on the right side. This matches the transformation of the ship on top, going from grayscale to color.

Therefore, (C) is the correct choice as it mirrors the grayscale to color transformation seen in the top row.",0,2DRotation180

A. The grapes and leaves remain in the same orientation; there is no rotation.
B. The grapes rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, similar to the ship's rotation.
C. The grapes rotate 90 degrees clockwise, which is the opposite direction of the ship's rotation.

To solve this visual puzzle, we first examine the transformation happening on top of the puzzle with the logs of wood. We can observe that the transformation involves a change in the orientation—the log is rotated so its cut face is shown in the second image.

- In option (A), the mouse undergoes a rotation. Initially, it is facing left, but in the second image, it is facing upwards. This matches the type of change seen in the log transformation, which is a change in orientation.
- In option (B), the transformation involves a change in size. The mouse is larger in the second image compared to the first. This does not match the transformation of the log, which is not about size change but orientation.
- In option (C), the mouse undergoes a flip, changing its direction from facing left to facing right. This is a mirror image or reflection transformation, not a rotation.

To solve the puzzle, let's examine the top transformation and then compare it to each of the three provided transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C).

Top transformation:

Now, let's look at the bottom transformations:

(A) - The mouse goes from facing left to facing right, but there's no change in state or use, just a change in orientation.

(B) - The object is an acorn, which goes from being whole to being opened with the nut visible. This represents a change in state, similar to the pencil being used and sharpened.

(C) - The mouse goes from facing upwards to facing downwards, which, like (A), is only a change in orientation.

Based on these observations, the transformation that most closely matches the transformation at the top is (B), where the acorn goes from a whole state to an opened or 'used' state, similar to the pencil being sharpened and ready to use.",0,2DRotation180
5,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation of the object, we observe that the log is being rotated from its original position. Between the two images of the log, there is no change in size, number, or color; the only change is in orientation.

2. We then apply the same criteria to the three sets of transformations at the bottom of the puzzle.

   - (A) shows a mouse that is first looking to the right, and then is flipped vertically to face the opposite direction. This is a change in orientation, but it differs from the top transformation because the mouse is also mirrored, not just rotated.
   
   - (B) shows a rotation of the mouse, where it is facing right in the first image and is then rotated to be upright in the second image. This matches the top transformation, which is a rotation around the longitudinal axis without any other changes.
   
   - (C) shows the mouse in the same orientation in both images; there is no transformation occurring between the two states.

2. Compare to option (A): The two barrier objects with yellow and black stripes appear to have rotated or flipped their positions horizontally but have not flipped upside down. This does not match the complete upside-down rotation seen in the top transformation.

3. Compare to option (B): The barrier objects in B have experienced an upside-down flip, similar to the top transformation. The positions are exactly mirrored just like the orientation change in the piano images.

4. Compare to option (C): The barrier objects in C also rotate, but the second object rotates 90 degrees to stand on its side, which does not match the upside-down flip of the piano.

- On the top of the puzzle, we see a grand piano that undergoes a transformation. The first image shows the piano at an angle, and the second image shows it straightened up but with the lid closed. The transformation here involves a change in orientation from angled to upright as well as a change in the state/openness of the piano lid from open to closed.

- Now let's look at the transformations for object (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle:

  - (A) shows two striped barriers placed at an angle in the first image and then with one barrier overlapping the other and both straightened in the second image. The change here involves a rearrangement of the bars and a slight change in orientation.
  
  - (B) shows two striped barriers where the first image has them apart and the second image shows one barrier slightly elevated or floating above the other. There is no change in orientation as the barriers remain horizontal in both images.
  
  - (C) shows two striped barriers with one placed diagonally in the first image and in the second image, both are placed vertically with one standing behind the other. There is a change in orientation and arrangement of the bars here.

   - There is no change in size, color, or number of cakes or strawberries.
   - The primary change is in the orientation of the cake.

2. Now, looking at the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle marked (A), (B), and (C), we need to identify which one has a similar type of transformation involving orientation like the one at the top.

3. Transformation (A) shows a sneaker that goes from a front/top perspective to a bottom perspective. This is a significant change in the orientation, but not consistent with the gentle rightward tilt observed in the cake transformation at the top.

4. Transformation (B) shows a sneaker that goes from a front/top perspective to a slightly rightward-tilted position. This closely matches the transformation of the cake at the top of the puzzle—there is no change in size, color, or number, but there is a shift in orientation.

(C) shows a creature that is changing both in terms of rotation and in its parts (e.g., the backpack moving from the back to the top of its head), but not merely rotating and changing orientation like the top example.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a coffee cup in its first image and then we see the second image where the coffee cup is turned sideways. This transformation involves a change in orientation from front view to side view.

2. Now, we analyze the transformations in each of the bottom sequences to find the one that matches the top transformation:

- In (A), the figure is a character that turns upside down from the first image to the second image. This is a change in orientation, but not the same type of orientation change we see in the top transformation.

- In (B), the character shifts from facing forwards to the side, similar to the top transformation where the coffee cup turns from front to side. This matches the type of orientation change seen in the top transformation.

- In (C), the character doesn't just turn; it also changes color and splits into pieces. This transformation is more complex and involves changes other than just orientation.

3. Based on these observations, the correct answer is (B) because it best represents the type of transformation seen in the coffee cup which is a change in orientation from front view to a side view without any other modifications like color change or splitting into pieces.",0,No change

2. Now look at the transformations of the airplanes marked as (A), (B), and (C).
3. In option (A), the airplane is rotated to show its underside. This is a different kind of rotation than the one seen with the gun, which goes from side to top rather than front to bottom. So, (A) is not the correct transformation.
4. In option (B), the airplane is flipped horizontally but retains the same orientation relative to the viewer's perspective. That is, the rotation seen in the gun's transformation does not happen here. So, (B) is also not the correct transformation.
5. In option (C), the airplane rotates similarly to how the gun does, going from a side perspective to a top-down view. This matches the original transformation seen with the gun. Hence, (C) is the correct answer.",0,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top involves a handgun that is rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the first image to the second image.

2. Now, examining the transformations on the bottom, marked with (A), (B), and (C), and comparing them with the top transformation:

   - Transformation (A) shows a biplane rotating, but the direction of the rotation is not consistent with the handgun transformation. The biplane appears to perform a flip rather than a simple 90-degree rotation.
   
   - Transformation (B) shows the biplane rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the first image to the second image, which is the same transformation observed in the top images.
   
   - Transformation (C) shows the biplane rotating in a manner that seems to align with the image sequence of (B), but the biplane continues its rotation further than 90 degrees between the images, resulting in a different final orientation from that of (B).

Thus, the transformation that matches the one on the top is (B) because it features the same 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.",1,2DRotation-90

Let's analyze the transformation that occurs from left to right in both the single object transformation on top and the three transformations on the bottom.

On top, we see a transformation of an object (a handgun) from an upright position to a side position, where it is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise.

Now let's look at the transformations on the bottom:

(A) shows a plane being flipped vertically; this is not a 90-degree clockwise rotation, so it is not the same transformation as the one on top.
(B) shows a plane being rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise, which matches the transformation on top.
(C) shows a plane rotating approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is the opposite direction of the transformation on top.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B), as it is the transformation that matches the 90-degree clockwise rotation seen on top.",0,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Top Transformation: The top sequence shows a green hat that undergoes a transformation from left to right. The change observes the hat rotating along its vertical axis.

2. Option (A): The object transformation does not match the top transformation. The bookshelf-like object is rotating, but the axis of rotation is about the horizontal axis, not the vertical one as in the top sequence.

3. Option (B): The transformation here matches the one in the top sequence. The bookshelf is rotating around its vertical axis, the same type of rotation that the hat undergoes. The left and right positions of the bookshelf correspond to the before and after rotations of the hat, respectively.

4. Option (C): This option does not match the top transformation either because the object is both rotating and changing its perspective/viewpoint, which results in seeing a different side and number of shelves in comparison to the left image, unlike the simple rotation observed in the top sequence.

Therefore, the lower transformation that matches the top transformation of the hat is option (B).",0,2DRotation180
11,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we can see the object is a green hat that has rotated to the right and slightly down, changing its orientation but maintaining its color, size, and shape.

2. For the transformation on the bottom:
   - In (A), the bookshelf rotates towards us but also flips upside down.
   - In (B), the bookshelf rotates to the right and slightly down, which is similar to the rotation of the hat in the top transformation.
   - In (C), the bookshelf rotates and also changes in perspective to appear more three-dimensional from the front, which is not comparable to the simple rotation seen in the hat transformation.

3. Comparing all these options to the transformation of the hat at the top, we can conclude that option (B) displays the same type of transformation – a rotation to the right and slightly down with no other changes, matching the pattern observed with the hat.",0,No change
11,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation which shows a green hat viewed from two different angles. The change here is purely rotational; the hat is being rotated to show a different perspective, but there is no change in size, color, or number of hats.

2. Compare this with the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C).

- (A) showcases an object being viewed from two different perspectives just like the hat. However, upon closer inspection, the object's size appears to change between the two images, making it different from the hat's transformation.
- (B) also shows an object from two different angles without any change in size, color, or number of objects, making it analogous to the transformation of the hat.
- (C) displays an object with two perspectives as well, but again, there is a slight change in size between the two images, just like in (A).

3. Since the only transformation that purely involves a change in orientation without alterations to size, color, or number is (B), it is the correct transformation that matches the top transformation of the hat.",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Let's look at the transformation of the object on top:
   - The object is a walkie-talkie.
   - The transformation involves the antenna of the walkie-talkie extending from a shorter length to a longer length.

2. Examining the transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C):
   - (A) shows a birthday cake that is being rotated.
   - (B) shows a cake with toppings that are falling off and changing positions.
   - (C) shows a cake with one layer (the top one) that appears first to have its size being reduced, and then its size is restored back to the original, so there is a change in size similar to the extension and retraction of the antenna in the top transformation.

3. Therefore, the transformation that is most similar to the top transformation is marked by (C), where there is a change in the size of the cake's top layer which directly correlates to the change in length of the walkie-talkie's antenna.",0,No change
12,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examining the top transformation of an object (a walkie-talkie), it appears to rotate and scale down from left to right. The antenna, oriented upwards on the left, points to the right in the following image, and the size of the object is smaller compared to the left image.

2. Evaluating transformation (A) on the bottom, the cake remains in the same orientation and there is no observable scaling or any other transformation.

3. Looking at transformation (B) on the bottom, the cake rotates and scales down from left to right, which mirrors the transformation observed in the walkie-talkie.

4. Observing transformation (C) on the bottom, there is rotation and scaling up, which is opposite to the scaling down observed in the walkie-talkie transformation at the top.

Thus, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation of the walkie-talkie, involving both rotation and scaling down, is option (B).",1,2DRotation-90

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the left-to-right transformation of the object on the top and then compare it to the transformations of the objects marked (A), (B), and (C) one by one:

1. The top transformation shows a radio, which changes its orientation from vertical to horizontal as we move from left to right.

Bottom Transformations:
(A) The cake changes its orientation from an upright position to a sideways position, similiar to the radio.
(B) The cake changes its orientation from an upright position while slightly rotated to a sideways position; essentially, it is rotated to its side. This matches more closely with the top transformation because the radio is shown directly from the side in its second image, just like the cake in sequence (B).
(C) The cake changes its orientation from an upright position to a top-down view, which does not match the transformation of the radio.

Since the transformation in the top sequence and sequence (B) involve turning an object onto its side to view it from a different angle, the correct answer is (B).",0,No change

- Option (B) shows only a change in the orientation of the figure's head, rather than a full rotation of the entire body.
- Option (C) shows a figure that starts the same but ends up inside a vessel with additional objects, which represents a change in context and an increase in the number of items rather than a rotation.

First, let's look at the visual transformation at the top of the puzzle, which involves a duck. The duck on the left is upright, and the duck on the right has been rotated clockwise 90 degrees and now appears on its side.

- (A) The object on the left displays an upright character, and the object on the right is the same character but viewed from a top-down perspective, indicating a change in perspective rather than a rotation.
- (B) It shows a character, and in the next panel, the character has been rotated clockwise, analogous to the duck's transformation. The character appears to have also moved from standing to lying on the back, which is consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- (C) The left and right objects are identical with no change; hence, no transformation is present here.

Based on the observed changes, (B) is the correct answer because it's the only option where the object undergoes a rotation similarly to the duck in the top transformation.",1,2DRotation-90

   - Option (A) shows a character standing upright and then shown on its side in an enlarged form, just like the duck above. This matches in both orientation and size change.
   - Option (B) only changes in orientation, not in size - the character is shown standing and then flipped upside down, but there is no change in size.
   - Option (C) involves an addition of objects (the character plus the hot air balloon basket and balloons) but does not reflect a change in the initial object's orientation or size.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's carefully examine the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle and then compare it with the transformations of the objects at the bottom marked as (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:

(A) Transformation:
1. The first image shows a colorful, upright caterpillar toy.
2. In the second image, the caterpillar toy has fallen over to its right side.
This doesn't match the top transformation because the caterpillar has not just rotated; it has also changed its orientation from upright to sideways.

(B) Transformation:
1. The first image shows the same colorful, upright caterpillar toy.
2. In the second image, the caterpillar has rotated approximately 45 degrees clockwise, similar to the way the couch on top has rotated.

3. Option (B) shows the Adirondack chair in an upright position in the first image and then rotated onto its back in the second image. This matches the transformation seen with the rose on the top, as it involves a rotation without changing other aspects of the object.

4. Option (C) shows the chair upright in the first image and then tilted forward on its legs in the second image. It appears to be a combination of rotation and pitching forward, which isn't a simple side rotation like the one seen with the rose.

- (C) shows the subject at an angle in the first image and then rotated to a position that is also sideways, which is somewhat comparable to the top transformation where the elephant flips onto its side.

     - Right: the same object/person rotated to face slightly more towards the viewer, with no change in size, color, or number.

(B) - Left: an object/person facing to the side.
     - Right: the same object/person rotated to face downward, with no change in size, color, or number.

(C) - Left: an object/person oriented with the head towards the top of the image.
     - Right: the same object/person rotated to face the left, with no change in size, color, or number.

Step 3: Determine which transformation matches the elephant transformation.
- The elephant in the top transformation undergoes a rotation without changes to size, color, or number.
- Option (B) is a similar transformation where the object/person rotates without any change to size, color, or number.

Let's analyze the transformation of the object on the top and compare it with the transformations of the objects on the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C).

1. On the top, the transformation involves a character that has changed orientation from standing upright to lying face down.

2. Now let's look at the transformations on the bottom:
   - (A) shows a snake with the same orientation in both frames, so there is no change in orientation.
   - (B) shows a snake that goes from a coiled-up resting position to actively rising up, which is a change in orientation, but it's not the same as going from upright to face down.
   - (C) displays a snake that transitions from an upright position to being turned upside down, closely matching the orientation change seen in the character on the top; it starts upright and ends upside down.

Therefore, the transformation sequence that matches the one on the top of the puzzle is (C), as both involve a change in orientation from upright to upside down.",1,2DRotation-90
20,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation: the character starts upright and then is flipped upside down but maintains the same color and structure.

2. Now examine each of the bottom transformations with the same principle:
   - (A) shows an object that remains upright in both images; therefore, it does not match the top transformation.
   - (B) shows an object that rotates but not to the same degree as the top transformation; it is not flipped completely upside down.
   - (C) shows an object that starts upright and then is flipped upside down, maintaining the same color and structure, just like the top transformation.

3. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because it matches the transformation of the character on the top, which is the character being flipped upside down while keeping the same color and structure.",1,2DRotation-90
20,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation of the character. The character starts off standing upright and then is seen lying face down from the same front-oriented perspective.

2. Examine Option (A): The snake is shown in different orientations but remains right-side up in both images, which does not match the top transformation where the character is upright and then not.

3. Examine Option (B): The snake starts off in a right-side-up position and in the second image is shown as if it has fallen onto its back, which mirrors the top sequence where the character is standing and then on its face.

4. Examine Option (C): The snake is right-side up in both images with only a slight change in the orientation of the head, which does not match with the transformation of the character that involves a more significant change in orientation from standing to lying flat.

Thus, the bottom sequence that corresponds to the top transformation is (B) because both show a change from an upright position to a prone position without altering the perspective.",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, we see a lion undergoing a left-to-right transformation which involves it being flipped horizontally. The lion is rotated around its vertical axis.

2. Option (A) shows a guitar that undergoes a transformation from being upright to being laid on its back. This is a rotation around the guitar's horizontal axis, not a flip like the lion.

3. Option (B) shows a guitar that is upright and then is flipped horizontally, similar to the lion on the top of the puzzle.

4. Option (C) shows two guitars with no change in orientation or position whatsoever, only an increase in number.

Therefore, the transformation in (B) matches the top transformation because both involve a flip around the vertical axis.",0,2DRotation180
21,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the top of the puzzle, we observe a lion undergoing a transformation from the left image to the right image. The transformation here involves a rotation (the lion is flipped upside-down) without any change in size, number, or color.

2. We examine each pair of transformations on the bottom of the puzzle:

   - In option (A), the left-to-right transformation shows a guitar that has been rotated (flipped upside-down) without any change in size, number, or color. This transformation matches the type of transformation we observed with the lion.
   
   - In option (B), the left-to-right transformation shows a guitar that has been reduced in size without any rotation, which is not the transformation we observed with the lion on the top.

   - In option (C), the left-to-right transformation shows a guitar that has changed color and orientation (it is now a different guitar with its neck pointing in the opposite direction), which again does not match the transformation of the lion.

3. The transformation in option (A) is the only one that matches the top transformation of the lion, which is a rotation without any changes in size, number, or color.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",1,2DRotation-90

The transformation seen at the top shows a lion that is upright in the first frame and then flipped upside down in the second frame, while maintaining the same size, orientation (other than being flipped), and color.

Now, examining the transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C):

(A) shows a guitar that remains upright and unchanged in orientation or color in both frames.
(B) shows a guitar that is upright in the first frame and then upside down in the second frame, without changes in size or color.
(C) shows a guitar that is upright in the first frame and then displayed from the neck point of view in the second frame, without being flipped upside down.

The transformation that matches the one on the top is (B) because it has the same operation applied to it: the object is flipped upside down in the second frame without any other changes, just like the lion.",0,2DRotation180
22,0,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

To come to this conclusion, let's go through a step-by-step analysis of the transformation in the puzzle:

Top Transformation (the object at the top of the puzzle)
1. The first image shows a flat, unfolded paper object.
2. In the second image, the object begins to fold upwards from the bottom.
3. The third image shows the object fully folded into a fortune teller (also known as a cootie catcher), a common origami shape.

We identify that the transformation involves a change in the shape or folding of the object.

Now let's analyze the transformations of the frogs marked (A), (B), and (C):

(A) Transformation
1. The first and second images are identical frogs with the same orientation and color.
2. The third image shows the same frog from a different angle but with no change in shape or color.

The transformation in (A) does not reflect the top transformation as there is no change analogous to folding.

(B) Transformation
1. The first image shows the frog in a standard posture.
2. In the second image, the frog is inflating or puffing up.
3. The third image shows the frog even more inflated.

In (B), the transformation involves a change in the size or inflation of the frog, which is not similar to the top transformation.

(C) Transformation
1. The first and second images are identical frogs with the same orientation and color.
2. The",0,No change
22,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

To arrive at this conclusion, let's examine the transformation of the object on the top and the transformations of the objects at the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C) in detail:

Top transformation:
- The object starts as a flattened, fan-like shape and transforms into a more three-dimensional, conical form with the tip pointing upwards.

Now, let's analyze the bottom transformations:

(A) shows a frog facing left, and in the second image, it's the same frog, unaltered, still facing left. There's no transformation in terms of orientation, size, number, or color.

(B) shows a frog that seems to rotate or reorient itself. In the first image, the frog is viewed from the side; in the second, it's viewed from a perspective looking down, with its back to us and limbs outstretched upward. This is an orientation change similar to the top transformation, where the object is reoriented from a flat shape to an upright one.

(C) shows a frog facing right, and in the second image, it's the same frog, unaltered, still facing right. There's no transformation in terms of orientation, size, number, or color.

Option (B) is the correct analogy because it represents a change in orientation, which matches the top transformation.",0,2DRotation180
22,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

To arrive at this conclusion, let's analyze the transformation pattern of the object on the top and then compare it with the transformations of the three different objects on the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:
- The object seems to be a fortune cookie that is broken open from left to right. The change occurs in its state, from being whole to being cracked with a visible separation, suggesting a sequence of an object opening.

Bottom Transformations:
- Option (A) shows a frog with the only noticeable change being its position or orientation within the frame. There is no transformation similar to the opening or separating of an object.
- Option (B) presents a frog that starts whole and seems to separate or spread apart as you go from left to right. The first image is an intact frog, the middle shows the frog as though it has puffed up or expanded with its limbs extending outward, and the final image shows a further extension, much like the top sequence but using a stretching action instead of a breaking one.
- Option (C) shows two frogs remaining consistent in state but increasing in quantity from left to right with no process of opening or separating.

Based on this analysis, option (B) shares the most similar transformation to that of the object on the top. It displays a process that could be analogous to the opening of the fortune cookie, by portraying a frog that is expanding or spreading out from left to right. Therefore, the correct answer",0,2DRotation180
23,0,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation presents a camel standing with all four legs on the ground, and then in the next image, it shows the camel leaping or galloping, which involves a change in orientation and position.
2. Looking at the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:
   - (A) shows an object rotating slightly in the horizontal plane, yet remaining in the same position.
   - (B) shows an object rotating from the horizontal position to a vertical position, indicating a change in orientation, similar to the camel's change from standing to leaping.
   - (C) shows an object changing from an upright vertical position to lying flat, which also includes a change in orientation but not a positional shift in the air.
3. The transformation that closely resembles the camel's motion from standing to leaping is option (B), as it depicts a similar change from one orientation to another while also including the sense of movement or positional change as observed in the leaping camel.",1,2DRotation-90
23,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

On the top of the puzzle, we observe a transformation of a camel from a standing position to a leaping or jumping position. This transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object, as the camel's entire body is rotated to create a sense of movement or action.

Now let's examine the bottom transformations:

- Option (A) shows a mallet with the head on the right and the handle pointing down, and in the next image, the mallet is in the same orientation with no change.
- Option (B) shows a mallet with the head on the right and the handle pointing down, and in the next image, the mallet is rotated 90 degrees with the head on the bottom and the handle extending to the right.
- Option (C) shows a mallet with the head on the right and the handle pointing down, and in the next image, the mallet is rotated and also disassembled, with the head detached and lying flat and the handle lying next to it.

The transformation that most closely resembles the one at the top is the one that involves a simple change in orientation without any other changes. Option (B) is the only one that demonstrates a change in orientation without changing the number of objects, their color, or breaking them apart.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",1,2DRotation-90
23,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(B)

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for choosing option (B):

1. Looking at the top transformation, the change is from a standing camel to a jumping camel. The transformation involves a change in the orientation and position of the camel, without a change in size, number, or color.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom:

   - (A) shows a maul (a tool with a large head and handle), which remains in the same orientation and position, and there is no change in size, number, or color. This does not match the top transformation.
   
   - (B) shows the maul with the head moving from a vertical position to a horizontal position and the handle also changing its position relative to the head (rotated 90 degrees), which is a change in orientation and position, similar to the top transformation from a standing camel to a jumping camel.

   - (C) displays the maul with the head moving to a horizontal position, but the handle has become disconnected and has laid down flat. This involves changes that go beyond just orientation and position; it suggests a disassembly, which is not the case in the top transformation.

3. Therefore, the transformation that matches the type of change seen in the top transformation (change in orientation and position without disassembly or change in size, number, or color) is (B).",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning for the choice:

Top Transformation (Couch): Observing the top transformation of the object, which is a couch, we can see a change in orientation from left to right. The couch is rotated around a vertical axis passing through the center of the couch. It starts in a normal position and ends up upside down.

Bottom Transformations (Geckos): 

(A) The first gecko is the starting position, and in the second position, it remains the same, with no apparent transformation.
(B) Looking at option B, the first gecko starts in the normal position and in the second frame, it is upside down, which matches the rotation seen in the transformation of the couch at the top.
(C) In option C, the first gecko starts in the normal position and in the second frame, it appears to be flipped around a horizontal axis rather than rotated around a vertical axis, which does not match the transformation of the couch.

Therefore, (B) is the correct transformation that matches the transformation at the top.",1,2DRotation-90
24,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The transformation at the top shows a couch that is rotating counter-clockwise when going from left to right. We can observe that the couch rotates approximately 90 degrees from its initial position.

Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom:

(A) Shows a lizard that moves from a horizontal position in the first frame to an almost identical horizontal position in the second frame. There is a very slight rotation, but it is not a 90-degree turn.

(B) Shows a lizard that moves from a horizontal resting position in the first frame to an upside-down position in the second frame. The lizard undergoes a rotation along its longitudinal axis, which is a 180-degree flip, not just a combination of rotations experienced by the couch.

(C) Shows a lizard that moves from a horizontal resting position in the first frame but is slightly larger in size in the second frame. There is no rotation or transformation besides the change in size.

Option (A) shows a slight rotation, but not the 90-degree rotation we're looking for. Option (C) shows a change in size, not rotation. The transformation that matches most closely with the top object is option (B), where the lizard is flipped upside down, representing a rotational change. Although it's a 180-degree flip compared to the 90-degree rotation of the couch, it's the only option that involves a similar type of transformation (a rotation along an axis), hence it",0,2DRotation180

   - (B) The gecko is rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise.

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to examine the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle and compare it to the transformations on the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C).

In the top transformation, we see an object (a baby stroller) that rotates 90 degrees clockwise from the first image to the second.

Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle:

- In (B), the cap rotates but not in the same manner as the object on the top; it seems to rotate slightly less than 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- In (C), the cap rotates 90 degrees clockwise from the first image to the second, which matches the transformation seen on the top with the baby stroller.

   - In (A), the hat rotates clockwise 90 degrees from left to right. This is the opposite direction of the rotation observed in the stroller.
   - In (B), the hat also rotates counterclockwise 90 degrees from left to right, which is the same direction as the rotation observed in the stroller.

Let's analyze the transformation patterns for both objects:

For the transformation at the top featuring the stroller:
1. The first stroller is in an upright position.
2. The second stroller is rotated counter-clockwise and its back is faced towards us.

Now, let's examine the three transformations on the bottom one by one:

(A) This transformation of caps involves:
1. The first cap presents the visor in the lower position.
2. The second cap has been rotated counter-clockwise, similar to the stroller, and its inside is facing towards us.

(B) This transformation of caps involves:
1. The first cap presents the visor in the lower position.
2. The second cap has been slightly tilted to one side, but not fully rotated to show its inside. This pattern is different from the stroller's, which is fully rotated to show the back.

(C) This transformation of caps involves:
1. The first cap presents the visor in the lower position.
2. The second cap is in the same orientation but slightly shifted upward; it is not rotated in any way.

- In choice (B), there is no change in orientation, size, or color between the first and second images of the snake toy; it remains in the same position.

- In choice (C), the snake toy is upright in the first image and completely inverted in the second, much like the motorcycle in the top puzzle.

2. Option A: The dinosaur toy is rotated slightly to the left (or counter-clockwise) from the first image to the second, which is a similar transformation to the motorcycle's rotation but not exactly 90 degrees.

3. Option B: The dinosaur toy is flipped upside down from the first image to the second. This is a different type of transformation (flipping over a different axis) compared to the motorcycle's rotation.

4. Option C: The dinosaur toy is rotated, and it appears the way it falls changes its orientation significantly. This goes beyond a simple rotation and involves a positional change that is different from a single axis rotation.

  (C) The first car is upright, and the second car is also upright but has rotated to show a different side while maintaining the same spatial position. The car's transformation reflects a change in orientation similar to the octopus's transformation, where it has rotated to show a different side while still being upright.

   - In option (C), the car does not rotate or flip at all; it remains upright in both images.

- Option (C) shows the figure facing forward in the first image and then rotated to show a side view, similar to how the house on the top underwent a rotation around its vertical axis.

- (A) shows what seems to be a chicken that remains unaltered from left to right, which means there is no transformation.
- (B) shows a chicken that undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation from left to right, which is the same type of transformation applied to the bicycle.
- (C) shows a chicken that flips from facing left to facing right, which is a different transformation (a reflection or flip, not a simple rotation).

Therefore, the transformation in (B) matches the transformation at the top of the puzzle.",0,2DRotation180
29,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Look at the top of the puzzle to understand the transformation of the bicycle. It has turned upside down from the left image to the right image. This indicates that the type of transformation we are looking for is a change in orientation.

2. Now, examine the bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C) to identify which one has a similar change in orientation:

   - (A) shows a chicken turning to face the opposite direction, but it is not flipped upside down. This is a rotation on the vertical axis but not an inversion of up and down.
   - (B) shows a chicken that has been turned upside down from left to right, matching the type of transformation seen with the bicycle on top.
   - (C) shows a chicken that remains upright but has been mirrored horizontally. This is not the same type of transformation as the one at the top.

3. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer, because it demonstrates the same type of transformation (change in orientation by flipping upside down) as the transformation shown with the bicycle at the top of the puzzle.",0,2DRotation180

To solve this puzzle step-by-step:

1. We look at the top transformation, which shows a cheese grater being rotated clockwise. In the first image, the grater is upright, and in the second image, the grater is tilted so that the top is further back than the bottom.

2. Now, we examine the transformations of the flower in (A), (B), and (C) to find a similar change:

    a. In (A), the flower is first shown from a front view and then from a bottom view, looking up.
    b. In (B), the flower is rotated in a similar fashion to the cheese grater, with the first image showing the flower upright and the second tilted in such a way that it appears to be leaning forward (the top closer to the viewer than the bottom).
    c. In (C), the flower is rotated to show the side view in the second image.

3. Looking at these options, it's clear that (B) represents the same transformation type as the one with the cheese grater at the top. The flower appears to rotate clockwise, just like the grater, changing the orientation in a way that corresponds with the grater's movement.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top, we can observe a stainless steel cheese grater. The transformation is from standing upright to being tilted on its side.

2. Now let's compare this transformation to the three options given below:

   (A) Shows a flower that goes from facing front to turning and facing to the left side. This is a rotation but not a tilt, as one part is not being elevated in relation to the other as in the cheese grater, so (A) is not the correct transformation.
   
   (B) Shows a flower that goes from facing front to tilting downward. This matches the top transformation, as one part of the object (the top of the flower) moves in relation to the other part, similar to how the top part of the cheese grater moves down when it is tilted on the side.
   
   (C) Shows a flower that goes from facing front to having its petals and leaves fall downward. This is a change in the structure and position of parts of the object, not just a simple tilt, so (C) is not the correct transformation.

Let's go through the step-by-step comparison process:

Top Transformation (cheese grater):
1. The transformation on top shows a cheese grater being rotated from an upright position to a tilted position.
2. No change in size, number, or color occurred, only a change in orientation.

Comparing Bottom Transformations (flowers):
A. Shows two identical flowers with no change in size, orientation, number, or color.
B. Shows a flower that rotates from facing straight up to tilting to the left.
C. Shows a flower with one of the blossoms changing orientation, pointing to the right in the final image, and the leaves slightly repositioned.

The bottom transformation that matches the top transformation is the one with the same type of change:

Option (A) does not show any transformation.
Option (B) shows a rotational change with no other transformations, matching the top scenario.
Option (C) shows a rotation of one part of the flower (the blossom) but also moves the position of the leaves which is not analogous to the transformation at the top.

To solve this visual puzzle, let us first look at the transformation of the object on the top row, which is a rabbit. The rabbit is initially standing, and then it changes its orientation to be on its side. There is no change in the size, color, or number of rabbits; the only change is in its orientation.

Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom row:

(A) Displays an ice cream with three scoops from above, then the perspective changes to a side view from an angle, revealing two scoops. There is no inherent change of orientation similar to the rabbit since the ice cream itself has not rotated; only the viewer's perspective has changed.

(B) Shows an ice cream with three scoops on top from the top-down view. Then it changes to a side view, revealing that one scoop has fallen and is now lying on the surface next to the cone. This is a change in the orientation of part of the object, which is similar to the rabbit's transformation from standing to lying on its side.

(C) Presents two images of an ice cream with three scoops on top, with no change in orientation, size, color, or number between the two images.

Since the transformation in (B) is the one that matches the type of transformation seen with the rabbit on the top (a change in orientation), it is the correct answer.",1,2DRotation-90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top of the puzzle, we see a rabbit transforming from an upright position facing forward to lying on its side.

2. We are looking for a transformation that involves a change in orientation of the object without a change in size, number, or color.

3. Analyzing option (A), we see that the ice cream transforms by rotating to a side view, which is a change in orientation. However, this does not match the top transformation where the object lies flat.

4. Analyzing option (B), the ice cream scoop changes from the top view to a side view, and it is also lying on its side similarly to the rabbit in the top transformation.

5. Analyzing option (C), we see a change in the number of ice cream scoops (from one to two), which does not match the type of transformation we see in the top puzzle where there is no change in number, only orientation.

2. Now, let's compare this transformation with the three given options on the bottom:
   - (A) shows a cup of ice cream from a top view to a side view without rotation.
   - (B) shows a cup of ice cream from a top view to a side view with rotation, similar to the rabbit's transformation.
   - (C) shows a cup of ice cream from a top view to a side view without rotation.

3. Since we are looking for a transformation that involves a change in orientation, specifically a rotation, option (B) is the only one that matches this, as the ice cream is shown upright in the first image and then rotated to its side in the second image.

Top Transformation:
- Observing the rooster from the top row, it appears that the left-to-right transformation involves the rooster rotating counter-clockwise when viewed from an overhead perspective.

Option (A):
- The cat in option (A) rotates clockwise from an overhead perspective. This is the opposite direction of the rooster's transformation on the top.

Option (B):
- The cat in option (B) rotates counter-clockwise from an overhead perspective. This matches the direction of rotation seen with the rooster's transformation on the top.

Option (C):
- The cat in option (C) remains facing the same direction, with no rotational transformation taking place at all.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we see a rooster that first appears in an upright position and then is flipped upside down in the second image.

2. We need to identify the bottom transformation that shows the same type of change.

   - Transformation (A) shows a cat sitting upright and then lying on its side in the second image. This is not the same change as the top transformation since the top transformation involves flipping upside down, not just lying on the side.
   
   - Transformation (B) shows a cat sitting upright in the first image and then upside down in the second image. This matches the top transformation where the object is also flipped upside down.
   
   - Transformation (C) shows a cat sitting upright in the first image and just begins to lie on its back in the second image. While it is moving towards an upside-down position, it is not fully upside down as in the transformation above.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Let's analyze the top transformation of the rooster first. The rooster rotates counterclockwise by approximately 90 degrees from the first image to the second. The size, number, and color of the rooster remain the same between the two images.

2. Now, we'll look at the transformations of the cat marked by (A), (B), and (C):

   - (A) shows a cat that shifts from standing to lying down between the first and second images. There is no rotation similar to the rooster, so this transformation does not match the top one.
   
   - (B) depicts a cat that rotates counterclockwise by approximately 90 degrees from the first image to the second, which is the same kind of transformation that occurs with the rooster on top.
   
   - (C) shows a cat that remains in the same pose but the image is slightly zoomed in between the first and second ones. There is no rotation like the rooster, so this transformation does not match either.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's compare the transformations that happen to the object on the top of the puzzle with the transformations applied to the objects on the bottom of the puzzle, which are in sequences (A), (B), and (C).

Looking at the top transformation:
1. The object (a toy or tool with coils around a central rod) rotates and flips from the first to the second image.
2. The final transformation from the second to the third image involves the object being knocked over, falling onto its side.

Now let's apply this analysis to the transformations at the bottom:

(A) There is a rotation happening from the first to the third image, but there is no flipping upside down.

(B) There is a flip from the second to the third image but the object does not fall onto its side.

(C) The chair rotates and flips upside down from the first to the second image, then the final transformation involves the chair being knocked over onto its side, which matches the transformation at the top.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- Looking at the top transformation of the object, an exercise roller, it goes through a rotation from the leftmost position to the rightmost position. The central position of the object at the top is upside down relative to the leftmost and rightmost positions.

- Now, let's examine the bottom transformations:

(A) shows a chair that is first upright, then lying on its back, and finally flipped and lying on its front. This transformation does not match the top, as the middle object is lying on its back rather than being upside-down.

(B) shows a chair that is first upright, then rotated but still sitting on its base, and finally upright again. This transformation is not a match either, as the top transformation involves an object that is upside-down in the central position.

(C) shows a chair that is first upright, then upside-down in the middle position, and finally upright again. This matches the top transformation where the object is also upside-down in the middle transition between the two upright positions.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation first. You can see that the object appears to be a wooden dumbbell with discs stacked along the handle.
2. From left to right, the transformation shows the number of discs increasing from five to seven, which means there is an increase in the quantity of elements in the object.

Now, examine each of the bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C):
- In (A), the chair falls over from the upright position to the side, so there's a change in orientation, not quantity.
- In (B), the chair breaks apart, showing an increase in the number of separate pieces, but the pieces themselves are parts of the original chair and not an increase in a repeated element (like the discs on the dumbbell).
- In (C), you see two office chairs in the first image and three office chairs in the second image. This mirrors the increase in quantity seen in the top transformation.

Since the transformation we're looking for involves an increase in the number of like objects, or an increase in quantity, the series of office chairs in (C) that increases from two to three is the transformation that matches the top sequence. The top sequence involves an increase in the number of like elements (discs on the dumbbell), and (C) involves an increase in the number of like objects (chairs).",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, the object is a cactus that is upright in the first image and then rotated clockwise and seen from the top view in the second image. This indicates a transformation involving orientation and perspective.

2. Looking at option (A), we see a pocket watch that remains unchanged in orientation or perspective from left to right; only the connecting mechanism (the loop or handle) changes in position. Therefore, the transformation is not the same as the top transformation.

3. Option (B) shows a pocket watch that starts upright and is then rotated such that we see it from the top view in a similar manner to the cactus transformation. This matches the transformation of the cactus at the top in terms of changing orientation and perspective.

4. Option (C) shows a pocket watch where the second image is simply size-reduced compared to the first with no changes in orientation or perspective. This is not the same transformation as the cactus.

Top Transformation (Cactus):

2. The cactus on the right is rotated 90 degrees to the left, resulting in a horizontal orientation, and it appears flattened due to the perspective change.

(A) Compass Transformation:
1. The compass on the left is upright, presented in a vertical orientation with the ring at the top.
2. The compass on the right is shown lying flat, maintaining the same orientation but changing its position relative to the viewer's perspective.

(C) Stopwatch Transformation:
1. The stopwatch on the left is upright, presented in a vertical orientation.
2. The stopwatch on the right is still in a vertical orientation but has been scaled up or appears closer to the viewer.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object on the top first:

The cactus undergoes a rotation. In the first image, the cactus is upright, and in the second image, it is lying flat. There is no change in color, size, or number of cacti—just the orientation changes.

Now let's analyze the transformations for each set (A), (B), and (C) one by one:

(A) The pocket watch goes from upright to slightly tilted on the right side. This is a small rotation, not a complete laying flat as in the top transformation.

(B) The pocket watch goes from upright to lying flat on its side (the winder is initially at the top, and in the second image, it is on the left). This mirrors the complete change in orientation of the cactus in the top transformation—both objects go from upright to lying on their side.

(C) The pocket watch goes from upright to turned over so that the face is not visible. This is not just an orientation change; it's a flipping of the object to hide the front, which is different from the simple rotation seen with the cactus.

Importantly, the shark's position rotates counter-clockwise.

2. Now, let's look at the transformations of the objects at the bottom.

   - For option (A), the backpack undergoes a change in perspective from front view to a side view. While this is a rotational change, it does not match the perspective shift of the shark, as it shows a clockwise rotation rather than counter-clockwise.
   
   - For option (B), the backpack is also rotated, changing from a front view to a top view. This rotation is counter-clockwise, similar to the rotation seen in the transformation of the shark at the top of the puzzle.
   
   - For option (C), the backpack changes orientation from standing upright to being tilted on its side. This is different from the transformation seen with the shark, as it involves a change in the orientation of the backpack's position rather than a change in perspective.

1. Top transformation: The shark plushie is shown in two steps – it starts in a normal swimming position and is then flipped vertically so that its belly is facing up. The change here is in orientation.

2. Bottom transformations:
   
   A. The backpack is shown in three steps with a change in orientation from the first to the second (rotated slightly to the left) and then a change in the pattern from the second to the third. This involves two different types of changes – orientation and pattern – which does not match the single change in orientation observed in the shark transformation.
   
   B. The backpack is shown in three steps with a change in orientation from the first to the second (rotated to show the front fully) and then a further change in orientation from the second to the third (rotated to show the front but slightly angled). This involves consistent changes in the same attribute – orientation – which matches the single change in orientation observed in the shark transformation.

   C. The backpack is shown in three steps with no change in orientation between the first and second (both showing the front), but then a change in size from the second to the third (the third backpack is slightly larger).

1. In the transformation on the top, we notice that the toy goes from being a duck car to a duck robot. The transformation involves a change in the orientation.

   - Option (A): The first slice of pizza turns a full 360 degrees and becomes upright in the second image, but in the third one, a slice has been eaten. This adds an additional transformation (the slice eaten) that does not align with the example above.
   
   - Option (B): The transformation here shows the pizza spinning in place from left to right, with no additional changes. The slice transitions from a flat orientation to an upright orientation maintaining the same 'composition', just like the duck example.
   
   - Option (C): This shows a slice of pizza lying flat, then standing upright, and finally a slice eaten, much like in option (A) but with different progression. This adds the extra transformation, similar to option (A).

    - **Color:** The number's color on the object changes from red to blue.

    - (B) Shows the pizza with one slice turned about 120 degrees clockwise. There's a rotation, but no color change or separation into distinct parts.
    - (C) Shows the pizza being rotated slightly counterclockwise and one of the slices has moved away and appears separate from the rest. 

3. Comparing to the top transformation: While transformation (B) has the rotational element, it lacks the color change and separation. In contrast, transformation (C) includes an element of rotation (albeit in the opposite direction), a slice that has separated from the main body of the pizza, which parallels the structural change in the top transformation, but there's no color change as such.

In the first image, the toy is assembled correctly, while in the second image, the toy is taken apart and its components are rearranged. This transformation involves the changing orientation and position of parts of the whole.

2. Bottom Transformations:
   - (A) shows a pizza with a slice missing. In the second image, the missing slice is flipped, but the pizza itself remains unchanged. This represents a change in the orientation of a part of the object.
   - (B) shows a pizza with a slice missing. In the second image, the missing slice is shown to have been eaten more, and there's a transition from a larger to a smaller size of the missing piece. This transformation, thus, involves a change in size, but the orientation of the missing slice remains consistent with its initial state.
   - (C) shows a pizza with a slice missing. In the second image, the remaining part of the pizza is smaller, which could suggest a change in the size of the object, but it's actually showing a change in the state of the missing piece from partially eaten to fully eaten, resulting in what looks like an overall smaller pizza.

To determine which sequence of transformations on the bottom corresponds to the transformation on the top, we need to carefully analyze the changes from left to right in both sequences.

Looking at the top transformation, the object (a toy with numbered parts) is being rotated from a frontal view to a side view. Let's characterize the transformations by their nature:

1. Change in orientation: the toy has been rotated approximately 90 degrees towards its right side.
2. Change in relative position: the head and body switch positions; the head goes to the right and the body with the number on it moves to the left.

   - (A) The guitar rotates but flips around its vertical axis. This is not a simple rotation as experienced by the kayak.
   - (B) The guitar rotates counter-clockwise without flipping, which matches the type of movement seen in the kayak's transformation.
   - (C) The guitar size increases without any rotation, which is different from the kayak's transformation.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the transformations:

Top Transformation (Kayak):
1. The kayak at the top of the puzzle starts in an upright position.
2. In the next image, the kayak is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Finally, the kayak has been rotated back to its original upright position.

Bottom Transformations (Guitars):
(A) The guitar rotates counterclockwise in the first transformation and returns to its starting position in the second.
(B) The guitar rotates clockwise (similar to the kayak) in the first transformation and returns to its starting position in the second, just like the kayak transformation.
(C) The guitar is duplicated in the first transformation with no rotation and remains unchanged in the second.

Let's break down the transformation of the object (kayak) on the top of the puzzle first:

1. The kayak is being rotated from facing upwards to facing to the right, or put another way, it is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Now let's analyze the transformations of the objects on the bottom of the puzzle:

(A) There are no changes in orientation, size, number, or color. The two guitars are identical.
(B) The guitar is being rotated; in the first image, it's facing upwards, and in the second image, it's facing to the right—this is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, similar to the kayak's transformation.
(C) The guitar is undergoing a flip from facing left to facing right; this is not a rotation but a reflection.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top one is (B), as both objects are being rotated 90 degrees clockwise.",0,2DRotation180

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation on the top, we see a butterfly. The butterfly undergoes a rotation between the first and second image, and between the second and third image, it undergoes a color change, specifically losing the orange color and becoming only black and white.

2. We will now compare this transformation to the transformations at the bottom with the foxes:

   - For option (A), the fox undergoes a transformation from being intact to appearing in disassembled parts. This is not analogous to the butterfly's transformation.
   
   - For option (B), the fox appears to rotate between the first and second images, similar to the butterfly's rotation. Then, from the second to the third image, the fox undergoes a color change, losing the orange color and retaining only the white and gray parts. This transformation is analogous to the butterfly's transformation, which involves both rotation and color change.
   
   - For option (C), the fox also undergoes a rotation between the first and second images but then loses a body part (the tail) between the second and third images, which is not the same type of transformation as the color change seen with the butterfly.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct one because it follows the same transformation pattern as the example given on the top: a rotation followed by a color change with the retention of certain colors.",0,No change

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation involving the butterfly, we notice that the butterfly changes orientation from the left to the right and also changes its wing position from open to closed.

2. We should look for a similar pattern of change in orientation and position of parts in the three options below:

- Option (A) shows a fox that is mirrored in the second image, but there is no change in the position of its parts, such as the legs or tail.
- Option (B) depicts a change in the position of the parts of the fox, as it goes from standing to lying down. However, there is no change in the orientation of the fox between the two images.
- Option (C) shows both a change in orientation (the fox is facing different directions in the two images) and a change in the position of its parts (the second image shows the fox in a different pose with its tail up).

3. Since the change in the puzzle involving the butterfly includes both orientation and position of parts, and option (C) is the only one that shows a similar kind of transformation for the object it features (the fox), option (C) is the correct analogy to the transformation shown at the top of the puzzle.",0,2DRotation180

To determine the transformation depicted in the top part of the puzzle, let's analyze the changes from left to right:

1. The butterfly starts with its wings open and upright.
2. In the second panel, the butterfly has its wings closed and is shown from a side view.

Now let's match this transformation with what's happening in the three options on the bottom:

(A) The left image shows the fox sitting upright, and the right image shows the fox laying down. This represents a change in the position from sitting to laying, but not a change in orientation or viewpoint.

(B) The left image shows the fox sitting upright, and the right image shows the fox from a side view, simulating a sitting side profile. This matches the transformation in the butterfly, where the view shifts from a frontal display to a side profile.

(C) The left and right images show the fox in the same orientation and there's no change in viewpoint between the two. It's simply replicated.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top transformation is (B), where both the butterfly and the fox show a change from a frontal view to a side view or profile view.",0,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation of the object (in this case, a clownfish). You can see that in addition to a change in orientation (the fish turns slightly), there is a distinct change in the pattern of the clownfish's coloration from the first to the second image. Specifically, the number of white stripes decreases from three to two, and the middle stripe disappears.

2. Now examine the transformations of the object (a sandwich) on the bottom, labeled (A), (B), and (C).

   - In transformation (A), the sandwich only changes in size, getting smaller from left to right without any change in orientation or contents.
   - In transformation (B), the sandwich changes in orientation (it rotates), and there is a change in the contents - the lettuce leaf that was visible in the first image on the right side is no longer visible in the second image.
   - In transformation (C), the sandwich just flips upside down without any change in its size, orientation (in the sense of its contents' positioning), or contents.

3. The correct transformation must involve a change in orientation as well as a change in the contents/number of elements, to match the top transformation.

4. Only the set labeled (B) meets both criteria. It includes a change in orientation (rotation) similar to that of the clownfish, and there's a change in the contents of the sandwich (removal of a visible",0,2DRotation180

1. Let's first identify the transformation on the top with the clownfish (anemonefish). The clownfish is rotated between the first and second images. No other changes (size, number, color) seem to be present.

2. Now, let's analyze the transformations for options (A), (B), and (C) with the sandwiches:

   - (A) shows a sandwich that is flipped horizontally (mirrored).
   - (B) shows a sandwich that decreases in size from left to right.
   - (C) shows a sandwich that is rotated, just like the clownfish.

(A) shows a sub sandwich that remains in a horizontal position from left to right without any change in orientation, size, number, or color.

(B) shows a sub sandwich that starts in a horizontal position and ends in a diagonal position, rotated slightly clockwise, which matches the type of transformation seen in the top puzzle.

(C) shows a sub sandwich that starts in a horizontal position and ends in a vertical position, with a rotation that is more extreme than option (B) and does not match the transformation on the top.

1. Looking at the top part of the puzzle, we can observe a backpack that is undergoing a 90-degree clockwise rotation from the first image to the second.

2. We now need to find which of the options (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom shows a similar transformation.

3. In option (A), the first and second images of the object show a color change from a striped pattern to a solid color. There is no rotation. So, this is not the same transformation.

4. In option (B), the first and second images of the object both have a striped pattern, but the object in the second image appears larger than in the first image. There is no rotation. So, this is not the same transformation either.

5. In option (C), the object in the first image undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation to achieve the orientation seen in the second image, which is the same type of change observed in the top transformation.

Let's go step-by-step to understand why:

1. Look at the transformation of the object on top, which appears to be a backpack. It starts facing one direction and then is rotated to face the opposite direction. Neither the size, color, nor the number of the object changes; only its orientation changes from facing left to facing right.

2. Now, let's examine the three transformations marked A, B, and C.

   - Transformation (A) shows an object that is rotated 180 degrees along the vertical axis between the first and second image. This is not only a simple left-to-right orientation change.
   - Transformation (B) shows an object that changes its orientation from facing left to right, which matches the type of transformation seen with the backpack on top.
   - Transformation (C) shows an object that has changed its position from being upright to being on its side between the first and second image. This involves a change in position/pose, but not the same kind of orientation change as seen in the backpack transformation.

Now we analyze the bottom transformations:

- In option (A), the creature is flipped horizontally from the first image to the second, with no change in orientation relative to the ground.
- In option (B), the creature is rotated from standing on all its legs with its head facing left to standing on its hind legs with its head facing upwards, which matches the transformation observed in the top sequence.
- In option (C), the creature is flipped vertically from the first image to the second, again with no change in orientation relative to the ground.

3. Option (B): This shows the same bunch of flowers, but the second image has the flowers slightly rotated and slightly moved upwards within the frame. There is no change in the number of flowers but the change is very subtle and not a clear rotation like in the top transformation.

4. Option (C): The first image shows a bunch of flowers oriented in one direction, while the second image shows the same bunch of flowers but rotated, similar to the croissant on the top. The number, size, and color remain unchanged, just the orientation has been altered.

1. The cup undergoes a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise and a horizontal flip. The handle, which is originally on the right, ends up on the left, and the orientation of the cup's pattern changes from upright to sideways, indicating the flip.

Now we look at the transformations for each line item at the bottom:

(A) The pig simply performs a jump, without any change in orientation or a flip. So, this one doesn't match the transformation of the cup.
(B) The pig appears to rotate and undergo a flip as it transitions from the left image to the right image: initially facing right and slightly inclined, it's facing left and significantly inclined in the second image.
(C) The pig just flips from facing left to facing right without a noticeable rotation.

Upon further analysis, looking at the bottom images:

(A) Is incorrect because there's no rotation or flip.
(B) The pig rotates and seems to flip, but the flip is vertical because after the rotation, the pig that was seemingly walking on the ground is now upside-down in the air, which is akin to a vertical flip.

1. The object on the left is upright facing forward and the object on the right is still upright but turned 90 degrees to the right. This change in orientation matches the transformation at the top.

3. Since (C) is the only sequence that presents a change in orientation similar to that of the cabinet (a simple rotation showing a different side), it is the correct answer.

2. We must find a similar transformation among options (A), (B), and (C).

3. In (A), there is no noticeable change between the left and right stuffed dogs. They have the same orientation, size, and color. 

4. In (C), there is a change in orientation, but it's a rotation that makes the stuffed dog end up partly on its side, facing differently than it did initially. This doesn't match the top transformation, because the wardrobe does not end up on its side; instead, it is just laid down.

5. In (B), there is a change from the stuffed dog sitting upright to being upside down, maintaining the front-facing orientation like the top transformation. This mirrors the wardrobe's change from upright to being laid down but still facing forward.

Therefore, (B) correctly mirrors the same kind of transformation as seen at the top of the puzzle, which is a change in orientation while keeping the ""front"" of the object facing towards us.",0,2DRotation180
47,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows a cabinet that is changing its orientation. In the first image, the cabinet doors are closed and facing the viewer. In the second image, the cabinet has been rotated so that the side with the doors is facing away from the viewer, and the back is now visible.

Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom with the stuffed dog:

(A) The first image shows the dog sitting upright with its front facing the viewer. In the second image, the dog is flipped over with its back facing up. This is a change in orientation, but unlike the cabinet, the dog has been flipped in a different axis (top to bottom rather than front to back).

(B) The first image shows the dog sitting upright with its front facing the viewer. In the second image, the dog is shown from the back with its front turned away. This is a change in orientation that mirrors the transformation seen with the cabinet at the top.

(C) The first image shows the dog sitting upright with its front facing the viewer. In the second image, the dog is tilted to its side, which is another change in orientation but not the same as the cabinet transformation.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer, as it shows the same type of transformation as the one at the top – a change in orientation where the front becomes the back from the viewer's perspective.",0,No change
48,0,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation at the top, we observe an object (a submarine) rotating from a horizontal position to a vertical position. The size, color, and number of the object remain unchanged. The only transformation is the orientation.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom:

   - (A) shows a fish also being rotated, but in addition to the rotation, the color of the fish changes from lighter to a darker shade. This introduces a transformation not present in the example.
   
   - (B) shows a fish rotating from a horizontal position to a vertical position, much like the submarine. There are no other changes - size, color, and number of the object remain consistent.
  
   - (C) shows a fish rotating and changing something else as well - a small yellow object (possibly a fin or an external part) is added to or becomes visible in the second image. This introduces an additional transformation not found in the example.
   
3. Since the transformation of the fish in (B) aligns with the transformation of the submarine at the top - a rotation without changing any other attributes - (B) is the correct answer.",0,2DRotation180
48,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the top transformation, we see that the object (a submarine) undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation from the first image to the second.
2. We then examine the bottom transformations, (A), (B), and (C), for a matching pattern of change. This involves identifying an object that is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Transformation (A) does not match because there is no change between the first and second images; the fish remains in the same orientation.
4. Transformation (B) also does not match because the fish is rotated but not in a way consistent with the top transformation. The fish in (B) is flipped over, which is a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis, not a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
5. Transformation (C) shows a fish that is oriented upright in the first image and then rotated 90 degrees clockwise in the second image, matching the submarine's top transformation.
6. Hence, the correct answer is (C) because it exhibits the same transformation as the one on the top, which is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.",1,2DRotation-90
48,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Top transformation: The object on top starts as a submarine facing left and transforms into the same submarine standing upright. The size, color, and number of submarines do not change; only the orientation changes from horizontal to vertical.

2. Bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a fish that is rotated upside down from left to right.
   - (B) shows a fish that starts facing left and ends facing upward, similarly to the submarine transformation on the top. There are no changes in size, color, or number; only the orientation changes from horizontal to vertical.
   - (C) shows a fish that starts facing left and ends facing right. It's a horizontal flip, unlike the vertical orientation change in the top transformation.

Therefore, the transformation pattern that matches the transformation on the top of the puzzle is (B) because it shows an orientation change from horizontal to vertical without altering the color, size, or number of the object.",0,No change
49,0,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation (the ship):
   - Between the first and second images, the ship appears to rotate 90 degrees to the right around its longitudinal axis.
   - Between the second and third images, the ship appears to rotate another 90 degrees in the same direction, totaling a 180-degree rotation from the original position.

2. In the transformations (A), (B), and (C) (the cylindrical object):
   - (A) Shows the object rotating 90 degrees to the right from the first to the second image around its vertical axis, and another 90 degrees between the second and third images, the same as the transformation of the ship.
   - (B) Shows the object increasing in size from the first to the second image, then returning to the original size in the third image.
   - (C) Shows the object doubling in quantity from the first to the second image, then returning to a single object in the third image.

3. Only Transformation (A) shows the same 180-degree rotation observed with the ship. The other transformations (B) and (C) involve changes in size and number, not the rotational change shown with the ship.

Therefore, the answer is (A).",0,2DRotation180
49,1,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation features a ship that rotates 90 degrees from the first to the second image.

2. Now, let's analyze the transformations in the bottom row labeled (A), (B), and (C).

3. Option (A) shows a sink basin with a pedestal that rotates to lie on its side from the first to the second image. This is not merely a 90-degree rotation; the basin also goes from upright to lying flat.

4. Option (B) shows a sink basin with a pedestal that rotates 90 degrees from the first to the second image, similar to the ship's rotation.

5. Option (C) shows a sink basin with a pedestal that appears to shrink in size from the first to the second image. This is a transformation in size, not rotation.

Therefore, the transformation in (B) matches the transformation of the ship on the top of the puzzle because both involve a 90-degree rotation without any other changes.",0,No change
49,2,0,-90,0,-90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Let's analyze each of the transformations:

Top Transformation (Ship):
- The ship starts facing to the right, then it is flipped upside down.

Bottom Transformations:
(A) The object is shown from two different angles but does not undergo any other transformation.
(B) The object is shown facing up, and then it is flipped upside down.
(C) The object is shown from a side angle and then it is rotated to show its bottom, but it is not flipped upside down.

Matching Transformation:
- Option (B) shows an object that gets flipped upside down from the first image to the second, which is the same transformation that occurs to the ship in the top transformation.

Thus, the transformation that matches the one on top of the puzzle is (B).",1,2DRotation-90
