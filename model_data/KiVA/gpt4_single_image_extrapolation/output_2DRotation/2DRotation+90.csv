The transformation depicted on the top of the puzzle shows the figure of a dog that rotates or flips upside down from the left image to the right image.

Examining the transformations presented at the bottom:

- Transformation (A) shows an object that seems to remain static without any rotation or flipping.
- Transformation (B) shows the object which rotates and is viewed from the top in the left image to a side view in the right image, similar to the flipping motion seen in the transformation at the top with the dog.
- Transformation (C) depicts the object without any rotation or flipping, similar to (A).

The only transformation among the three that matches the top transformation by involving a change in orientation or viewpoint is transformation (B).",1,2DRotation+90
0,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, we can see that the object (a dog) rotates from an upright position to lying on its back. Thus, the transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object.

2. Now, we examine the three sets of transformations on the bottom.

3. For option (A), the object (a submarine) remains in the same orientation in both images, so there is no change in orientation.

4. For option (B), similar to (A), the submarine remains in the same orientation in both images, so there is no change in orientation.

5. For option (C), the submarine changes orientation from horizontal to vertical, which matches the change in orientation observed in the top transformation with the dog.

Since the change of orientation (from one direction to another) is the transformation type that both the dog and the submarine in option (C) share, the answer is (C).",1,2DRotation+90
0,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a dog transforming from standing on all fours to flipping onto its back in mid-air. This transformation involves a change in the dog's orientation but not its size, color, or number.

2. Option (A) shows an object (a submarine) rotating slightly to the right between the two frames. This change is in orientation but not to the same extent as the dog flipping onto its back.

3. Option (B) shows the submarine staying the same size and color but rotating 180° horizontally to face the opposite direction. This matches the kind of change we see in the dog's transformation, where it also flips 180° but in a vertical plane.

4. Option (C) shows a change in the orientation of the submarine, but it also shows a change from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one (standing on its tail). This is a change in the dimension of rotation, contrasting with the type of flip depicted in the top image of the dog.

Therefore, (B) is the correct transformation matching the top one as it's the only option where the object undergoes a 180° flip without changing size, color, or number, similar to the dog's action.",0,No change

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for my choice:

1. Let's first analyze the top transformation of the object, which is an electric fan. We observe that the fan goes from an upright orientation to a tilted orientation while maintaining the same size, color, and number.

2. Now, let's compare this transformation with the transformations presented in options (A), (B), and (C), which feature a box of French fries.

3. In option (A), the transformation shows the French fries box going from an upright position to being on its side. This is a change in orientation, similar to the fan.

4. Option (B) also shows a change in orientation, with the French fries box tilting towards us, much like how the fan tilts in its transformation.

5. Option (C) shows a change in position but not an orientation change; the French fries box remains upright while it moves in space, which differs from the fan's transformation.

6. Comparing these, option (B) is the most similar transformation to the one at the top because it's the only one where the object's orientation changes while the size, color, and number remain consistent with the original state, just like the fan's transformation.

So (B) is the transformation that matches the top one.",1,2DRotation+90
1,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Let's break down the transformation of the object at the top first:

1. The object on the top is a desk fan. It starts in an upright position and ends up lying on its side with the front facing to the viewer's left.

Now, let's analyze the transformations of the objects marked (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

A. Shows a carton of fries with no change in orientation, number, size, or color between the two images.
B. Shows a carton of fries with the carton turning over and the fries spilling out. There is a change in the orientation of the carton and fries, similar to the fan, but the fries are no longer contained within the carton, which is unlike the fan's transformation where all parts remain intact and connected.
C. Shows a carton of fries where the carton remains intact and merely rotates onto its side, akin to the fan's transformation where all parts remain intact and connected.

Option (C) best matches the top transformation as it involves a simple rotation of the object onto its side while retaining its original form, similar to the fan's transition from standing to laying on its side without dispersal or disconnection of any parts.",1,2DRotation+90
1,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, we examine the transformation that occurs with the desk fan from the left image to the right on the top row, and then determine which set of transformations on the bottom rows (A), (B), or (C) is analogous to this transformation. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Desk fan on the top row:
   - In the left image, the desk fan is upright.
   - In the right image, the desk fan is on its side.

2. Looking at the transformations on the bottom row:
   - (A) shows fries in an upright container, and then the container is on its side, much like the desk fan. However, the fries fall out of the container, which is not analogous to the top row as the structure of the fan remains intact.
   - (B) shows fries in an upright container, and then the container is on its side just like the fan, with the fries still inside the container, maintaining the structure and integrity, just as the fan blades remain within the fan's frame.
   - (C) shows fries in an upright container in both images with no change in orientation.

Based on these observations, the transformation in (B) is analogous to the transformation of the desk fan, where the object maintains its structure but changes its orientation.",1,2DRotation+90

Let's analyze the transformations step by step:

Top Transformation (Rocking Horse):
- First image: The rocking horse is right side up.
- Second image: The rocking horse is upside down.

Bottom Transformations (Toy):
(A) 
- First image: The toy has a right side up, front-facing orientation.
- Second image: The toy is still right side up but rotated to show the back.

(B) 
- First image: The toy is right side up, front-facing.
- Second image: The toy appears to be slightly turned to one side but is still right side up and front-facing.

(C) 
- First image: The toy is right side up.
- Second image: The toy is upside down, similar to the transformation seen with the rocking horse on the top.

The transformation pattern that matches the top transformation (flipping from right side up to upside down) is therefore seen in (C).",1,2DRotation+90
2,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top row, we observe a rocking horse that is facing left in the first image and then facing right in the second image. The transformation involves a change in orientation (the horse has been rotated along the vertical axis).

2. Now let's examine the transformations on the bottom row:

   - In (A), the object (which appears to be a spherical character or toy) is facing upwards in both images, so there's no change in orientation, only a slight change in perspective.
   
   - In (B), the object is initially facing downwards in the first image and then upwards in the second image. This implies a vertical flip or rotation along the horizontal axis, changing the orientation of the object.
   
   - In (C), the object is facing upwards in both images, similar to (A), with no change in orientation.

3. The transformation that matches the top row's rocking horse is the one where the orientation changes. Since (B) shows a change in the orientation of the object (flipped from facing downwards to facing upwards), it matches the top row transformation most closely, which also shows a change in orientation (although the axis of rotation is different, the principle of changing orientation is the same).
",1,2DRotation+90
2,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Let's analyze the transformation on the top segment with the wooden horse:

1. The wooden horse is initially upright.
2. In the second image, it rotates counter-clockwise approximately by 90 degrees.
3. Finally, in the third image, the horse rotates further in the same direction (counter-clockwise) to lie flat on its back.

Now let's evaluate the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C):

- In transformation (A), the object rotates, but the rotation is clockwise between each step.
- In transformation (B), the object undergoes not only a rotation but also a translation (it moves from the center to the right side of the frame).
- In transformation (C), the object rotates counter-clockwise between each step, with no translation observed.

Option (C) mirrors the transformation seen with the wooden horse: a sequential counter-clockwise rotation without translation or any other change. Therefore, (C) matches the transformation sequence displayed by the wooden horse on the top of the puzzle.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

Top Transformation:
- The object on top appears to be a molecule model undergoing a rotation from the left side to the right side. The first image shows the molecule model from one angle, and the second image shows the same model from a different angle due to rotation. We can infer this because the relative positions of the atoms (represented by spheres) change in a way consistent with a three-dimensional rotation. There are no changes in size, number, or color of the atoms; it's purely a rotational transformation.

Bottom Transformations:
- (A) The object is an illustration of an eye. From the first to the second image, the eye changes orientation from facing front to somewhat facing upwards and adds additional elements (ears, forming a face). This transformation involves both a rotation and a change in the number of elements (from just an eye to an eye with ears and a face). Therefore, it is not the same transformation as the one on top.
- (B) The second set of images also show the same object—an eye. Here, the change from the first to the second image involves only a rotation, with the eye looking leftwards initially and then turning slightly to look more towards the front. This transformation is similar to the rotation observed in the molecule model, with no change in size, number, or color.
- (C) In the third set of images, the eye undergoes a change in orientation that is more like a flip rather than",0,No change
3,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation at the top involves a molecule-like structure that rotates and changes color from a lighter shade to a darker shade.
- Now, let's examine the transformations at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C).

(A) The creature is facing left and has a small body size in the first image, then it grows larger and faces right in the second image. This change involves the orientation (direction the creature is facing) and size (from smaller to larger).

(B) The creature begins facing right and then turns to face left. This change involves only the orientation without a change in size or color.

(C) The creature, in the first image, has a lighter color, and in the second image, it becomes darker without changing size or orientation.

Since the top transformation includes both a rotation (which is analogous to the change in orientation in the figurines at the bottom) and a color change (from light to dark), we can see that option (C) is the only sequence at the bottom that matches both aspects of the transformation at the top: it maintains orientation and changes from a lighter to a darker color. The change in size or complete orientation reversal as seen in (A) and (B), respectively, do not match the type of transformation shown at the top.",0,No change
3,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the top transformation: The object on the left is a complex molecule made up of several spheres connected by rods, and the object on the right is the same molecule but with a change of orientation, such that it is flipped 180 degrees in the plane of the image.

2. Compare the top transformation with the bottom transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C).

3. Transformation (A) shows the object slightly rotated, but the angle of rotation is not 180 degrees. This disqualifies (A) as the correct match.

4. Transformation (B) shows the object first facing one direction and then flipped to face the opposite direction, which represents a 180-degree flip in the plane of the image. This matches the transformation observed at the top.

5. Transformation (C) shows the object rotating around its vertical axis, but this rotation is not the same as the flip observed at the top. Therefore, (C) is not the correct match either.

As only transformation (B) reflects the same type of change as seen in the top transformation—a 180-degree flip in the plane of the image—(B) is the correct answer.",0,2DRotation180

   - The transformation shows the ship rotating counterclockwise, as viewed from above. The bow (front part) of the ship points to the right in the first image and to the top in the second image.
   - There are no changes in size, number, or color of the ship.

2. Bottom Transformations Analysis:
   - (A) The bunch of grapes moves from one side to the other without any rotation. This does not match the top transformation.
   - (B) The bunch of grapes rotates counterclockwise, similar to the ship's transformation. The stem points down in the first image and to the left in the second image. This matches the top transformation.
   - (C) The bunch of grapes remains static with no changes in orientation, size, color, or number. This does not match the top transformation.

2. Now, examine the transformations below:
   - (A) The bunch of grapes moves from one side to the other, with no rotation or flipping indicated.
   - (B) The grape cluster stays in the same position but appears to rotate around a central vertical axis, similar to the ship rotation above. The leaves, which were initially pointing right are now pointing left, which indicates a rotation without changing the position on the screen.
   - (C) The bunch of grapes moves from one side to the other, like in (A), without any visible rotation relative to its own axis.

   - (A) shows a bunch of grapes with a stem facing to the right and then to the left, which only involves a change in orientation.
   - (B) shows a bunch of grapes with a stem facing upwards and then downwards, which is a change in orientation.
   - (C) shows a bunch of grapes with a stem facing upwards and then downwards. Moreover, the grapes lose color saturation, becoming grayer, just like the ship on top.

(A) Mouse Transformation:
- The object (mouse) remains static and unchanged from left to right.

(B) Mouse Transformation:
- The object (mouse) transforms similarly to the top transformation: the mouse starts upright (left) and then is on its back with its legs up (right), suggesting a change in orientation similar to the log opening and angling upwards.

(C) Mouse Transformation:
- The object (mouse) transforms from an upright orientation to titled sideways, which does not match the opening-up transformation observed in the log example.

Therefore, the transformation that best matches the top transformation is (B), where the mouse changes orientation from an upright position to being on its back, aligning with the log's change from a closed to an open and angled-up position.",1,2DRotation+90

To solve this visual puzzle, we examine the transformation exhibited in the top row and then compare it with the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) in the bottom row. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. In the top row, we see a brown object of a particular shape and size. In the transformation from left to right, the object rotates around a horizontal axis. The color and size of the object remain the same, but the orientation changes due to the rotation.

2. Now we analyze the bottom row transformations:

   - In option (A), the left-to-right transformation shows a mouse that rotates around a horizontal axis, similar to the top object. The size and color do not change.
   - In option (B), the left-to-right transformation shows a mouse that moves position but retains the same orientation; it does not rotate.
   - In option (C), the left-to-right transformation shows a mouse that rotates around a vertical axis, which is not the kind of rotation we observe in the top row.

3. Comparing the transformations, it is clear that option (A) mirrors the same type of transformation seen in the top row—rotation around a horizontal axis without change in size or color.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Look at the transformation of the object on top from left to right: it is a rectangular solid object that appears to rotate or tip forward so that the angle at which we view it changes. The left side shows the object with its larger face parallel to the viewer, while the right side shows the object with its larger face at an angle to the viewer. Essentially, it's a change in orientation from a front-facing view to a tilted view.

2. Now examine the transformations in the three options (A), (B), and (C).
   - In option (A), the left image shows a mouse facing directly to the right. In the right image, the mouse is still facing to the right but has tipped downward, changing from an upright to a more angled orientation.
   - In option (B), the left image shows a mouse facing right, while the right image shows the same mouse but now facing a bit downward. This is a subtle change in direction of facing or head orientation, not the entire body.
   - In option (C), the left image shows a mouse facing to the right, while the right image shows the same mouse but now facing more upwards, which also represents a change in direction of facing or head orientation.

1. In the top transformation, the object appears to be showing a change in orientation from the left to the right image. The object, which seems to be a piano, is rotating counter-clockwise when going from the left to the right.
   
2. Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom part of the puzzle:

To determine which of the three transformations (A, B, or C) on the bottom of the puzzle is the same as the top transformation, let's examine the transformation process step by step:

Top Transformation:
1. The object (a grand piano) is rotated or flipped from one side to the other, changing its orientation from left to right.

Bottom Transformations:
A. The object (a barrier with a horizontal striped pattern) appears to rotate around a vertical axis, altering the position of the striped part relative to the solid base.
B. The object undergoes a mirror flip, changing the orientation of the striped bar from slanting down to the left to slanting down to the right, which is similar to a left-right flip of the top object.
C. The object changes in size, with the striped part becoming larger from left to right, which does not match the transformation of the top object.

The transformation in (B) most closely matches the transformation on top, as both involve a change in orientation resembling a mirror flip from left to right. The orientation of the striped pattern on the barrier changes from tilting to the left to tilting to the right, which is analogous to the piano's change in orientation from the first image to the second image on the top row.",0,2DRotation180

1. In the top transformation, the object (a part of a piano) starts in one position and orientation and ends up in a different position and orientation. There's no change in the size or color of the object, only in its placement and the way it's oriented.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
   - Transformation (A) shows two objects that swap their positions from left to right. This is not a match to the top transformation where the single object itself changes orientation.
   - Transformation (B) shows an object that changes in orientation like the top transformation; however, the orientation change is different—the object on the top stood up, while the object in (B) lays down.
   - Transformation (C) shows an object that also stands up between the two images, which parallels the change observed in the top transformation.

The transformation at the top shows the cake slice being rotated around a vertical axis. The left image of the cake slice has the strawberry positioned on the left side, while in the right image, the strawberry is positioned on the right side, indicating the cake has been rotated 180 degrees horizontally.

Now, comparing this to the transformations of the shoes at the bottom:

Option (A) shows a pair of shoes that are facing left in the first image and facing the same direction in the second image. There is no rotation involved, so this option does not match the top transformation.

Option (B) shows a shoe facing left in the first image and the same shoe rotated to face downwards in the second image; this involves a rotation around a horizontal axis and aligns with the type of rotation seen in the cake slice at the top, which is the criterion we are looking for.

Option (C) shows a shoe facing left in the first image and then the same shoe rotated to face right in the second image; this rotation appears to be around a vertical axis but looking at the sole of the shoe, indicating a different kind of rotation than what we're looking for.

(B) The shoe is flipped over, so we see the sole instead of the top.
(C) The shoe is both rotated and flipped, changing its orientation and perspective.

Option (A) shows a rotation of the shoe similar to the transformation seen with the cake on the top row. The shoes in (A) are rotated in a way that we see a different side in the second image which matches the cake's transformation, where we also see a different side in the second image.

   - (B) shows the squirrel plushie rotating to face down which is different from the transition at the top.
   - (C) shows the squirrel plushie being rotated slightly to the right. It remains in the same upright position; therefore, this change is different from the one at the top.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top transformation, a coffee cup is rotated from an upright position to lay on its side from left to right.
- Now we look at the bottom transformations:
  - (A) shows a character and then the character turned upside down. This is not the same transformation as the top because no rotation to the side is involved.
  - (B) shows a character and then the character rotated to lay on its side, which is the same kind of transformation observed at the top with the coffee cup.
  - (C) shows two images of a character in the same orientation and position, so there is no transformation that matches the one on top.

Therefore, the transformation in (B) matches the transformation on the top, which is the rotation from an upright position to lay on its side.",1,2DRotation+90
9,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Looking at the transformation of the object on the top, we see a coffee cup. The transformation shows the cup being rotated from an upright position to a side view, while the design on the coffee remains visible and unchanged.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations of the object on the bottom:

   a. (A) features an animated character. From left to right, this character is transformed by being turned upside down and changing its color from yellow to blue.
   
   b. (B) also features the same animated character. From left to right, the character is rotated to show a side view. Unlike in (A), there is no color change; only the orientation of the character is changed, similar to the coffee cup on top.
   
   c. (C) shows the character first upright and then duplicated, resulting in two characters side by side. This transformation involves a change in number, not in orientation or color.

3. The transformation in (B) is the most similar to the transformation of the coffee cup on top because it only involves a change in orientation without altering the color or adding more objects. The character in (B) is rotated to give a side view, matching the rotation of the coffee cup without changing its position or design appearance.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on top is (B).",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation. The object, which appears to be a toy gun or pistol, rotates from an upright position to a flat position. It is essentially a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

2. Now, look at the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a toy plane that changes its orientation while still maintaining the same side facing up. This is not just a simple rotation.
   - (B) shows the toy plane rotating 90 degrees clockwise, which is the same transformation observed in the top object. The side of the plane that was facing up is now facing to the right, which matches the gun's transformation.
   - (C) exhibits a change in the plane's pitch, not its overall orientation in the 3D space as viewed from this perspective.

3. The transformation in (B) is consistent with the one seen at the top and is therefore the correct answer.",0,2DRotation180

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation of the object on top first, and then compare it to the three transformations of the different object on the bottom, marked (A), (B), and (C).

Looking at the top transformation, we see:

- The object (a tool) is rotating from the left to right image, and there is a change in its orientation from a top-down perspective to a side-on perspective. 

Now let's look at the transformations on the bottom:

- (A) shows a plane moving from left to right without any apparent rotation or change in orientation.
- (B) shows a plane that is rotating about its longitudinal axis; the plane is viewed from the top in the first image and from the side in the second image, matching the type of transformation observed in the top object.
- (C) shows a plane moving from left to right without any apparent rotation or change in orientation, similar to option (A).

Thus, the transformation in (B) is analogous to the transformation on the top, where the object rotates and its orientation changes when viewed from one image to the next.",1,2DRotation+90
10,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Let's analyze the transformation of the object on the top first, and then compare it with each option marked (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:
- The object on the left appears to be a side view of a gun; the object on the right is rotated downwards, showing a view of the gun where the grip is facing upwards while the barrel is pointing to the left. Essentially, it's a rotation around the horizontal axis of the object.

Now let's analyze the transformations on the bottom:

(A) Transformation:
- Here, the airplane's orientation changes from facing right to facing the viewer with a nose-up attitude. This is not simply a rotation around the horizontal axis but involves a change in the plane's pitch as well.

(B) Transformation:
- This one shows the airplane rotating around its horizontal axis, similar to the rotation observed in the gun. Initially, the airplane is seen from the side, and then it is seen from the top with the propeller facing upwards. This is the closest to the rotation of the gun on top.

(C) Transformation:
- The airplane changes from a side view to an angled view where the tail is closer to the viewer than the nose. This involves both a rotation and a change in perspective, different from the rotation of the object on the top.

By comparing the nature of the rotations, we can conclude that the transformation which matches the top object's transformation is (B), as both involve the",1,2DRotation+90

To solve this visual puzzle, observe the transformation that occurs in the top sequence with the hats, and then identify which of the three bottom sequences with the bookcases (A), (B), or (C) undergoes a similar transformation.

The transformation of the top object (the hat) involves a rotation. The first hat is shown facing forward, and the second image shows the hat being rotated so we are looking at it from above.

Now let's analyze the transformations of the bookcases:

- In (A), the bookcase is rotated, similar to the hat on top, giving us the view from a different angle in the second image. Specifically, it seems to rotate clockwise and slightly upwards, giving us a view that shows more of the top of the bookcase.
- In (B), the bookcase is also rotated, but unlike (A), the rotation gives us a view that seems more to the side rather than from above.
- In (C), the bookcase's second image is not merely a rotation but a reflection as well, as the structure is mirrored along the vertical axis.

The sequence that matches the transformation type of the top sequence the best is (A), where the bookcase is simply rotated without being mirrored or altered in any other discernible way, much like the hat.",1,2DRotation+90
11,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(A)

Let's go step-by-step to identify the transformation that happens from left to right with the hats, which will help us identify the correct answer:

1. The top row shows a hat that rotates as we move from the left image to the right. The hat is initially viewed from the side and then viewed from above.
2. Now, looking at the objects in the bottom row (A), (B), and (C), we need to find a similar transformation.
3. In (A), the bookshelf is similarly rotating, going from a side perspective to a top-down perspective.
4. In (B), the bookshelf is rotating, but it's viewed from a different angle as we move from the left image to the right, showing a bottom-up perspective rather than top-down.
5. In (C), the bookshelf is merely shifted in space without any rotation.

The transformation in (A) matches the transformation of the hat on top because both involve a rotation that results in a top-down view. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",1,2DRotation+90

The transformation at the top shows a hat that is first in its normal orientation and then flipped vertically to show its underside. We need to look for a similar transformation among the objects at the bottom, which is a vertical flip.

Option (A) shows a bookcase in one orientation and then flipped vertically (upside down) just like the hat. The second image of the bookcase is the underside of the first image.

Option (B) shows a rotation of the bookcase, and it remains upright. It is not the same transformation because the bookcase is placed at an angle, showing a different side, but not flipped vertically.

Option (C) also shows a rotation but in a different direction from (B), but like (B), the bookcase is not flipped upside down.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top one is (A), a vertical flip of the object.",0,No change

To reach this conclusion, let us analyze each set of transformations step by step:

Top Transformation:
1. The object is a walkie-talkie.
2. From left to right, the antenna becomes extended. The overall shape, size, and color remain the same.

Bottom Transformations:

(A) Here we have a three-tiered cake with decorations.
    From left to right, the cake rotates, likely a 90-degree turn, changing its orientation but keeping the shape, size, and color consistent.

(B) This sequence also includes the same cake.
    From left to right, the cake undergoes a similar rotation to what we see in sequence (A). There's no visible change in size, color, or shape.

(C) This sequence involves the same cake as well.
    From left to right, the cake is shown from a top-down view, changing its orientation significantly where the top is now facing the viewer.

By comparing these transformations with the transformation of the walkie-talkie on the top, we can see that none involves a change in antenna size. However, option (B) involves a change in orientation without altering the other features, which is the most similar to the walkie-talkie's antenna extending. While the walkie-talkie's antenna extends rather than rotates, option (B) is the only sequence that depicts a single change similar in nature (a simple transformation of one aspect of the object), i.e., a change",0,No change
12,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the top transformation and then compare it to transformations (A), (B), and (C) to find the one that matches.

Top Transformation:
1. A grey object with a cylindrical lower part and an antenna-like extension on the top starts in an upright position.
2. In the middle image, the object is lying on its side, with the antenna extending to the right.
3. In the final image, the object returns to an upright position, resembling its initial state.

Analyzing Bottom Transformations:
(A) The cake starts upright, then flips upside down, and finally returns to an upright position. This sequence involves a flip but not a rotation to the side like in the top transformation.

(B) The cake starts upright, then rotates to lie on its side with the top of the cake facing right, and finally rotates back to the upright position again. This sequence perfectly matches the top transformation, involving a transition to the side and a return to the initial orientation.

(C) The cake starts upright, then rotates to lie on its side with the top of the cake facing left, and finally rotates back to the upright position again. This sequence involves a rotation to the side but in the opposite direction compared to the top transformation.

Therefore, the bottom transformation that matches the top one is (B), as it includes the same change in orientation—rotating to the side and then returning to the upright position.",1,2DRotation+90
12,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation of the object. It shows a walkie-talkie positioned upright, then on its side, and finally flat with its antenna pointing to the right. This sequence of transformations involves a change in orientation of the walkie-talkie.

2. Now examine the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

- (A) shows a cake with the inscription ""Happy Birthday"" visible and facing forward, then rotated to show the side of the cake, and finally positioned with the inscription facing down.
- (B) shows the cake in a similar sequence to the top transformation: upright with the inscription facing forward, then on its side with the inscription still visible from the top, and finally flat with the inscription facing to the right.
- (C) shows the cake upright with the inscription facing forward in all three transformations but moving further away, indicating a change in size or perspective rather than orientation.

3. Since the orientation change in the sequence labeled (B) matches the orientation change in the top transformation of the walkie-talkie, the correct answer is (B).",0,2DRotation180

First, let's analyze the top transformation of the object:

1. The object on the left is a gold-colored rubber duck facing the viewer.
2. The object on the right is a squirrel, also in a gold color, facing to the right and away from the viewer.

The transformation involves a change in orientation (the duck is facing forward whereas the squirrel is facing right) and a change in the type of object itself (from a duck to a squirrel).

Now let's analyze the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

(A) The transformation is from an upright, forward-facing figure to an upside-down, forward-facing figure. This change involves orientation but not a change in the type of object.

(B) The transformation is from an upright, forward-facing figure to an upright, backward-facing figure. This change involves a shift in orientation similar to the top transformation, where the object goes from facing towards to facing away.

(C) The transformation shows no change; the figure is upright and forward-facing in both pictures.

The only bottom transformation that matches the top in terms of changing the orientation related to the viewer is choice (B). The figure is turned to show the back, similar to how the duck is changed to show the side of the squirrel turned away from the viewer.",1,2DRotation+90
13,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation on the top shows a duck changing into a squirrel. The change occurring here involves the object itself being entirely different in species and form, while remaining a single object with no variation in color.

2. Option (A) displays a change from a standing figure to a figure lying down, effectively transforming its orientation while still representing a single object with no color change.

3. Option (B) depicts a transformation from a standing figure to two figures turned upside down in a container, indicating a change in number and orientation.

4. Option (C) demonstrates a simple change in orientation as the figure rotates slightly to the right, but remains the only figure, and maintains the same stance.

Comparing these three transformations to the top one:

- Option (A) is the only one that involves a complete change in the orientation of the object without changing its number or color, similar to how the duck transforms into a completely differently oriented squirrel.
- Option (B) involves changes in number and orientation, which does not match the top transformation.
- Option (C) only involves a slight change in the orientation without the complete transition to a different state like in the top transformation.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) because it is the only transformation that most closely resembles the type of change seen in the top transformation from duck to squirrel.",1,2DRotation+90

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the objects step by step:

Top Transformation (Duck to Squirrel):
1. The duck is initially in an upright position.
2. The transformation to the squirrel involves a change in orientation (the squirrel is upside down) and a change in animal (from a duck to a squirrel).

Now let's inspect the bottom transformations:

(A) The left-to-right transformation of the first object shows a change in orientation (the figure is upside down in the second frame) but also includes disassembly, which is not a characteristic seen in the top transformation.

(B) The left-to-right transformation of the second object shows only a change in orientation (the figure is upside down in the second frame) with no other changes. This matches the change in the top transformation, which involves only a change in orientation (aside from the change in object type, which is not a factor for matching the transformation type).

(C) The left-to-right transformation of the third object shows a change in orientation (the figure remains upright) but also a change in the number of objects (an extra object is added in the second frame).

The correct answer is thus (B), because the transformation from the first image to the second image only involves a change in orientation, which is the same kind of transformation observed in the top set of images (disregarding the change in object type).",0,No change

3. Option (A) shows the caterpillar rotated to its side.
4. Option (B) shows the caterpillar also slightly lifted at one end but remaining in contact with the ground on the other, similar to a tilt.
5. Option (C) presents the caterpillar rotated to view from the front, with no tilt or lift.

The correct analogy to the top transformation is a tilt or a lifting at one end while the other end remains in contact with the ground without a significant rotation from the original orientation.

2. Now, we examine the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) to identify a similar pattern of transformation.

(A) In this transformation, the object (a colorful toy) rotates slightly counter-clockwise. This is not the same transformation observed at the top.

(B) In this transformation, the object (the same kind of colorful toy) rotates slightly clockwise. The amount of rotation appears to be slight and is not comparable to the rotation of the couch on top.

(C) In this transformation, the object rotates significantly clockwise, resembling the same type of rotation as the couch on top. This appears to be a rotation of about 45 degrees clockwise, which matches the type of change we observed above.

(C) There are two images of a caterpillar toy. The first image shows it upright, and in the second image, the toy is rotated onto its side. This is a rotation, but it's different from the transformation shown on the top.

- In the second image, the deer remains identical in color and size but has rotated 180 degrees along the horizontal axis giving the appearance that it is upside down.

Top Transformation:
1. We start with an island that has orange leaves on green ground.
2. In the next image, the island has rotated counterclockwise, and some of the leaves have turned grey.

We need to find a transformation that matches this process among the options given at the bottom.

Bottom Transformations:
(A) The drill changes perspective from a side view to a top-down view, which is not present in the transformation at the top.
(B) The drill rotates counterclockwise, and part of the drill (the back end) changes color from blue to a lighter shade, similar to the leaves turning grey. This change seems to also involve a shift in perspective, as the drill is seen from a slightly different angle.
(C) The drill rotates 180 degrees, so it's upside down in the second image, which is not a transformation seen with the leaves at the top.

Option (B) is the closest match because it includes a rotation and a change in color on a specific part of the object.

   - (C) The second image of the shoe is identical to the first, indicating no transformation has occurred.

18,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation of the puzzle shows an airplane changing its orientation from left-facing to top-down view.

2. We need to find which of the three transformations below (A), (B), or (C) matches this type of change.

Option (A): Shows a shoe that seems to rotate from front view to a view from above, showing the insole—this involves a change both in orientation and perspective.

Option (B): Shows a shoe that changes in orientation to a side view and also becomes split in half vertically, revealing the interior—this involves both a change in orientation and a change in the integrity or state of the object.

Option (C): Shows a shoe that changes in orientation from a front view to a top-down view without any alteration to the integrity or state of the shoe—this mirrors the airplane's transformation.

Since option (C) best matches the same idea of simply changing the orientation without altering the other characteristics such as color or state, it is the transformation that matches the top one.",0,No change
18,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows an airplane that is initially upright and then becomes inverted (upside-down) from left to right.

2. We need to observe the three transformations at the bottom and identify which one undergoes a similar change.

(A) The shoe is shown from a full side view on the left to a viewpoint that prominently shows the sole on the right. The transformation involves a change in perspective or orientation, but it's not an inversion.

(B) Here the shoe is rotated from an upright position to an inclination towards its side. The transformation involves tilting and not a full inversion.

(C) The shoe is initially shown from a side view and then is shown inverted from left to right. This mirrors the top transformation of the airplane, where it also ends up inverted.

Therefore, the transformation that is the same as the top transformation of the airplane is (C).",1,2DRotation+90

Let's analyze the transformation from left to right for both the object on top and the objects in (A), (B), and (C).

Top Object Transformation:
1. The left image shows a whole elephant.
2. The right image shows the same elephant but only as a silhouette, which is hollow or cut out. 

Bottom Object Transformation:
(A) The object rotates from left to right, no change in its completeness or color occurs.
(B) The object is colored and three-dimensional on the left, and on the right, it becomes transparent and only the outline remains, similar to the transformation of the elephant at the top.
(C) The object is colored and three-dimensional on the left, and in the right image, it is transparent with a slight change in color, but it is still three-dimensional and not just an outline.

The correct answer is (B) because, just like the elephant at the top, the object goes from a colored, opaque, three-dimensional form to a transparent outline which represents the same type of transformation: going from a solid object to an outline/hollow object.",0,No change

To solve this visual puzzle, let's compare the transformations of the objects on the top with the transformations in options (A), (B), and (C):

1. The top transformation shows an elephant that first appears in a complete and upright form and then in a fragmented and upside-down form. The changes involve a rotation (upside-down) and fragmentation (breaking apart).

2. In (A), we see a figure of a person on a snowboard. In the first image, the figure is complete and upright, and in the second image, the figure is fragmented while still maintaining the same orientation (right-side up). This matches the rotation observed in the elephant transformation but not the fragmentation.

3. In (B), the figure is again a person on a snowboard. The first image is complete and upright, but the second image shows the figure fragmented and in an upside-down position. This matches both the rotation (upside-down) and fragmentation (breaking apart) seen in the elephant transformation.

4. In (C), the figure undergoes no rotation or fragmentation, as the first and second images are identical.

The option that exhibits both a rotation (turning upside-down) and fragmentation (breaking apart) just like the top transformation is (B). However, to align with the provided instructions, I will reevaluate my response.

To solve this visual puzzle, we'll analyze the transformation of the object on the top (an elephant) and then apply the same logic to find the corresponding transformation among the three options (A), (B), and (C) with the other object (a figure of a person on a snowboard).

1. Top Transformation Analysis:
   - The elephant on the left is whole and facing to the right side of the viewer.
   - The elephant on the right is fragmented into separate pieces and rotated so that it is now facing downward from the viewer's perspective.

2. Bottom Transformation Analysis:
   - Option (A) shows a person on a snowboard facing downwards (towards the viewer), and in the next image, the person is broken into pieces while still facing downwards.
   - Option (B) shows a person on a snowboard facing to the left and then the same figure facing to the left but tilted slightly backward.
   - Option (C) shows a person on a snowboard facing downwards and then the same figure facing to the right.

3. Result:
Since the transformation that matches the one on the top (an object whole, then broken into pieces and rotated) is represented in option (A) (a person whole on a snowboard and then broken into pieces), the correct answer is (A).

(B) Shows the snake rotating in a way that is analogous to the top transformation – the head and tail ends maintain their orientation while the body flips, similar to the character flipping from standing to lying down.

(C) Shows the snake rotating to face the opposite direction but remaining in the same plane, which is more akin to a horizontal 180-degree rotation and not the same as the character's movement.

3. For option (B), the guitar remains in the same orientation from left to right. There is no transformation. It remains upright and does not turn upside down or change orientation.

4. In option (C), the guitar starts in an upright position and is then turned upside down from left to right. This matches the transformation seen with the lion on the top, where the lion also turns upside down.

(C) The guitar is shown twice; in the second image, it's smaller and facing the opposite direction. There is a transformation here, but it involves a change in size and orientation without changing to a different object, which does not match the lion's transformation.

1. Top Transformation: We observe a lion who turns from standing on all fours to a position where it is flipped and laying on its back. The lion's color and size remain constant, while its orientation changes dramatically such that if we consider the lion to have a ""top"" and ""bottom,"" these are reversed by the end of the transformation.

2. Bottom Transformations:
   - (A) The guitars are identical in both orientation and appearance.
   - (B) The guitar rotates, with the body of the guitar moving from the left side to the right side, but there is no change in color or size. This change in orientation is similar to the lion's in that what was previously on one side is now on the other side.
   - (C) The color of the guitar changes from black to brown, and it appears that the neck of the guitar is shorter in the second image, although the orientation doesn't change.

   - In (B), the frog changes orientation and seems to ""unfold"" from a side view to a more top-down perspective, revealing more of its body, which is similar to the paper object on the top becoming more open and revealing more surface area.
   
   - In (C), the frog morphs from a healthy-looking creature to one that appears damaged and with missing parts (such as limbs), which is dissimilar to the stable condition of the paper as it unfolds.

   - (C) shows a frog that changes orientation and part of the frog's body gets cut or removed from left to right which is not similar to an opening or unfolding motion.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation seems to depict a folding or closing motion. The object on the left appears more open, with multiple segments spread out. In the transition to the right, these segments come together, giving the impression of a folded or closed state.

C. The car is rotated, but not in the same manner as the octopus. It's flipped onto its side rather than turned upside down.

Since transformation (B) mirrors the 180-degree rotation observed in the transformation of the octopus on the top, it can be considered analogous.",0,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Top transformation: The transformation shows a house being rotated around a vertical axis. The first image is the front view and the second image is the side view, showing a 90-degree rotation to the right from the perspective of the observer.

2. Bottom transformations:
   - (A) Transformation: The character is first standing and then is shown upside down. This is not a rotation around a vertical axis, so it's not the same transformation as the top.
   - (B) Transformation: The character rotates 90 degrees to the right, maintaining the upright orientation. This is the same kind of transformation as the top one, where an object/character is being rotated along a vertical axis.
   - (C) Transformation: The character is duplicated, which is a change in the number of objects, not a rotation.

Therefore, the transformation that is the same as the top transformation of the puzzle is (B).",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the transformation on the top, we observe that the barn-like structure is rotating. It starts facing forward and then turns to show its side from a slightly different perspective. There's no change in color, size, or number.

2. Let's compare this to the transformations on the bottom:
    - (A) shows a character facing forward in the first image, and still facing forward in the second image. There's no apparent change, so this does not match the top transformation.
    - (B) shows a character facing forward in the first image and then upside down in the second image. Though the rotation is around a different axis (vertical rather than horizontal), it still represents a rotation change without alteration to color, size, or number, similar to the barn's transformation.
    - (C) shows a character facing forward in the first image and then turned to face her right side in the second image, which is a directional change but not a full upside-down rotation.

3. Therefore, the transformation that best matches the one on the top is (B) since it is the only option that shows a rotation of the object without changing its color, size, or number.",0,2DRotation180
28,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation of the house, the change happening from left to right is a 90-degree clockwise rotation along with a change in perspective that reveals a different side of the house.

2. Now we have to find a transformation with similar properties among the options given.

3. In option (A), the character is the same in both images, with no changes in orientation, size, color, or number. So this option does not match the transformation of the house.

4. In option (B), the character also shows a transformation which involves rotation but is followed by an upside-down orientation which is not present in the house transformation. Additionally, the character on the right appears smaller than the one on the left, which is a type of transformation not observed in the house example.

5. In option (C), the character is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, similar to the house's rotation. This rotation also changes the perspective, showing a different side of the character, just as a different side of the house is shown after its rotation.

6. Therefore, option (C) presents the transformation that matches the top puzzle's transformation, based on similar rotation and change of perspective without the introduction of additional changes such as scaling or flipping.",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, the transformation involves a bicycle that rotates from a normal upright position to an upside-down position between the first and second images.

2. Looking at the three options on the bottom of the puzzle:

- (A) shows a chicken-like object that remains upright in both images, with only a slight change in the orientation of its head and tail. This does not match the top transformation of flipping upside down.
  
- (B) shows a chicken-like object that transitions from standing upright to an upside-down position, mirroring the top transformation of the bicycle.

- (C) shows a chicken-like object that changes from facing left to facing right without flipping upside down. This does not match the top transformation either.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) since it perfectly matches the complete upside-down rotation seen in the top transformation with the bicycle.",1,2DRotation+90
29,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a bike being flipped over from right-side up to upside down while maintaining the same size, color, and orientation relative to its position (front of the bike is still facing the same way). The transition is about the axis the bike is flipped over.

2. Now let's examine the options:
   - (A) shows a duck rotating from facing left to lying on its back while its orientation (front of the duck is still facing the left) and color remain constant.
   - (B) shows the duck rotating from facing left to facing right with no change in its vertical orientation (it's still standing).
   - (C) shows a scale transformation where the duck goes from a normal size to a larger size, without changing its horizontal or vertical orientation.

3. We're looking for a transformation that most closely resembles a flip over an axis, similar to the bike being turned upside down.

4. Option (A) is the correct choice because it shows the duck being flipped backward over its horizontal axis (its feet stay in the same orientation), much like the bike is flipped over its axis. The transitions in options (B) and (C) do not involve this kind of flip: (B) is a horizontal flip, and (C) is a scale change.",1,2DRotation+90

To arrive at this conclusion, let's examine the transformations of the object on top and compare them to the transformations of the different objects on the bottom:

Top transformation:
- The bicycle is rotated and flipped upside down from left to right. The orientation changes drastically but the size, color, and number of bicycles remain the same.

Bottom transformations:
(A) - The object (which appears to be a stylized depiction of a bird) is simply rotated to the left, retaining its upright orientation. The transformation here involves rotation without flipping the object.
(B) - The object undergoes a similar rotation to the bicycle on top; it is not only rotated but also flipped upside down.
(C) - The object is rotated but also changes in size, becoming smaller from left to right.

Since we are looking for the same kind of transformation observed in the top sequence, we can see that option (B) matches the type of rotation and flipping transformation of the bicycle. The bird-like object is both rotated and flipped upside down, just like the bicycle. Options (A) and (C) do not match this transformation because (A) only includes rotation without flipping, and (C) includes both rotation and a change in size, which is not present in the top sequence.",0,2DRotation180

To determine which transformation on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation on the top, we must carefully analyze the changes made to the object in each step.

Top Transformation:
- The object (a cheese grater) appears to be rotating; it starts upright and ends up angled to the side.

Now, let's look at the bottom transformations and compare them to the top transformation:

(A) The flower rotates and then changes the face that is visible, turning to show a side view with fewer visible petals.
(B) The flower maintains the same orientation without rotating, but changes position, moving from the center to the right side within the frame.
(C) The flower changes by having one of its elements (the flower head) move to a different position relative to the other elements (the leaves) without changing its overall orientation.

The transformation that displays the same behavior as the one on top is (B) because in both cases, the object is moving its position within the frame without rotating or changing the orientation of its elements. The cheese grater moves from the left side of the frame to the right side upright, while the flower moves from the center of the frame to the right side, also maintaining its orientation.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation. We see a grey object (a cheese grater) that is rotated from left to right. There is only a change in the orientation of the object; there is no change in color, size, or number.

2. Examine the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom to find a similar pattern of change.

- For (A), we see the flower maintaining the same orientation but changing in position within the frame from the left to right side. There is no rotation, so this does not match the top transformation.
  
- For (B), the flower rotates around a central point from the first image to the second, which is a similar change as seen with the cheese grater on the top. There's no change in color, size, or number—just like the top transformation.

- For (C), the flower is not rotated but reflected from left to right, changing its orientation with respect to the central axis. This is a different kind of change from the rotation seen in the top transformation.

Therefore, (B) matches the transformation seen on the top because it shows the same type of change: a rotation without altering other aspects of the object.",0,2DRotation180

1. In the top transformation, a cheese grater is shown facing up in the left image, while the right image shows the cheese grater flipped so that its opening faces downwards.
2. Option (A) shows a flower whose position remains unchanged from left to right, so there is no transformation similar to the grater's flipping.
3. Option (B) shows the flower rotated 90 degrees to the left from the left image to the right image. This is analogous to the grater’s flip from up to down.
4. Option (C) shows a change in both the flower's position (a slight rotation) and its parts (the petals have shrunk and the leaves have grown), adding an element of size transformation that is not present in the grater's transformation.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top with the cheese grater is (B), because it involves a rotation similar to the flipping of the grater.",1,2DRotation+90

4. Transformation (C): The sundae is shown from two different angles, but rather than rotating, it seems to be viewed from an overhead perspective in the second image.

Top Transformation (Rabbit):
- The object (rabbit) is rotated counter-clockwise and its orientation and perspective change from an upright frontal view to a top-down view.

Now let's compare this transformation to the transformations in the bottom examples with the ice cream object:

(A) The ice cream scoops are rearranged in the bowl. This differs from the rotation in the top transformation.
(B) The ice cream perspective changes from an upright frontal view to a top-down view. This matches the rotation in the top transformation.
(C) The object (ice cream) becomes smaller, which is not the same type of transformation as the rotation shown in the top with the rabbit.

4. Option (B) shows a cat facing upwards in the first frame and upside down in the second frame, indicating a rotation around a horizontal axis, which matches the top transformation of the rooster.

5. Option (C) shows a cat slightly scaled down or further away from the viewer in the second frame than in the first frame, indicating a change in size or perspective.

   - (B) shows a cat standing normally in the first frame and then appears to have rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise in the second frame, which matches the pattern observed with the rooster.

- (B) shows a cat rotating its body such that its head turns to face us directly, again without a flip.
- (C) shows a cat first facing to the side and then flipped to face the opposite side, which is similar to what is seen with the rooster at the top.

1. First, let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle. It's a spindle with rings on it.
   - In the first image, the spindle has six rings positioned at the center.
   - In the second image, the spindle also has six rings, but they are now shifted to the top.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations in each of the options below (A, B, and C) to figure out which one features a shift similar to the one at the top:

   (A) The first image shows an upright office chair. The second image shows the same chair tipped over.
   - This represents a change in orientation, not a shift of parts of the object.

   (B) The first image shows an office chair right-side up. The second image shows the chair's seat and backrest detached and the backrest has been moved above the seat.
   - This transformation is similar to the one at the top, with the parts of the object moving relative to each other without changing orientation or leaving the frame.

   (C) The first image shows an office chair right-side up. The second image shows the chair sideways with the seat detached and placed away from the backrest.

2. Now let's analyze the transformations for each set marked by (A), (B), and (C).

3. Option (A) shows a chair that remains right-side-up in both images; its position changes but not its orientation. Therefore, it doesn't match the transformation at the top.

4. Option (B) shows a chair that is right-side-up in the first image and then turned upside-down in the second image. This matches the type of transformation that we see at the top with the wooden toy — it is a rotational transformation that results in an upside-down orientation.

5. Option (C) shows a chair that goes from being right-side-up in the first image to upside-down in the second image, similar to (B). But the second chair in (C) is also displaced from its original position, creating a sort of mirrored effect, while the top transformation only involves rotation without changing the position in relation to the central axis.

   - Option (A) shows a chair which is first upright, then knocked over onto its side, and finally right-sided again but rotated 90 degrees horizontally. This is not the same transformation as the one on the top because the object on top is rotated vertically, not horizontally.
   - Option (B) shows a chair which is first upright, then flipped upside down (rotated 180 degrees vertically), and finally upright once more. This matches the transformation at the top which shows the object flipped upside down vertically.
   - Option (C) shows a chair which undergoes a slight rotation while remaining upstanding but no flipping upside down. This is unlike the top transformation which involves a complete vertical flip.

   - (C) shows a change in orientation of the pocket watch as well, but it is more like a 180-degree rotation.

Now let's examine the transformations of the clock objects, marked by (A), (B), and (C):

- For option (C), we have the clock on the left upright. The clock in the middle frame is tilted to the right, and the clock on the right is tilted even more to the right.

The transformation in option (A) matches the transformation on the top with the cactus: an object going from an upright position to lying flat on its side. The transformations in options (B) and (C) involve rotation or tilting, which are different from the top transformation.

- The transformation from the second to the third shark is a change in orientation or perspective: the shark is flipped and viewed from the other side.

(B) The first transformation rotates the lunch box, similar to what happens to the shark. The second transformation changes the orientation or perspective, showing the other side of the lunch box as if it has been flipped over, which mimics the shark's transformations exactly.

(C) The first transformation is a rotation of the lunch box, but in the second transformation, the lunch box is not flipped to show the other side; instead, it appears simply to have been rotated again. This does not match the top sequence.

Similar to the transformation on top, there are both a 90-degree rotation and a color change, as the missing slice's border changes from a crust color to green.

The most noticeable changes here are the rotation from left to right and the change in the object's visible features (number replaced by letter, color change). 

2. Now let's analyze the transformations of the objects in the sequences (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:
   - In (A), the object (a slice of pizza) rotates clockwise and some toppings are removed. There is no switch of a feature analogous to the number ""2"" to the letter ""N"".
   - In (B), the object also rotates, but this time one topping (pepperoni) changes to a different topping (green pepper). This is similar to the change of the number ""2"" to the letter ""N"".
   - In (C), the object rotates and a piece is removed (bite taken from the slice). This does not fit the type of feature change seen in the top sequence.

1. Looking at the object transformation at the top, we see a toy shaped like a duck going through a series of changes from the first image to the third:

   - In the second top image, the toy is rotated to show the front and has no number on it.
   - In the third top image, the toy shows its right side and has the number ""2"" on it again.

   - Option (B) shows the pizza with a bite taken out on the left, rotated to show the whole pizza in the middle, and then with a bite taken out on the right. This matches the transformation at the top—rotation and a temporary change in appearance (in the top it's the number that disappears and comes back; in this case, it's the bite that makes a temporary change).

- (A) shows two images of a giraffe without any rotation or color inversion, so it does not match the top transformation.
- (B) shows a giraffe going from standing to a fallen position without rotation or inversion, so it also does not match the top transformation.
- (C) shows a giraffe going from a normal upright stance to an upside-down orientation, representing a 180-degree flip.

Given the options, (C) provides the closest match to the transformation at the top, involving a rotation or flip that results in the object being upside down compared to its original orientation. However, there is no number inversion like the number changing on the robot. Since the task is to find the same transformation and there isn't a perfect match with any of the options provided, the correct answer is:

3. Option (B) shows the same giraffe three times; first standing, second lying on its back, and third standing but facing the opposite direction.

4. Option (C) shows a giraffe getting smaller from the first panel to the second.

5. The correct transformation should involve a change in orientation while a part of the object flips horizontally.

6. Only option (A) shows a similar transformation: the giraffe changes orientation from lying down to standing up without any additional changes to size, number, or appearance, reflecting the kind of transformation seen on top with the toy duck.

Therefore, the answer is (A).",1,2DRotation+90

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

Looking at the transformation on the top of the puzzle, we observe a duck figure, which starts facing left, then rotates to be upside down, and in the last stage rotates to face right in a horizontal flip.

Now, compare this transformation with the sequences provided at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C):

- In sequence (A), we see a giraffe standing normally, then flipped upside down, and finally flipped horizontally to face the right, mirroring the duck's transformation.
- In sequence (B), we see a giraffe standing normally, then flipped upside down, but the final image shows the giraffe standing normally again, which is not a horizontal flip as per the top transformation.
- In sequence (C), the giraffe is standing normally and then appears to move closer or increase in size without any flip or rotation.

- (B) shows a guitar that flips vertically from left to right.
- (C) shows two identical guitars but from the left to the right, one of them rotates 180 degrees along its horizontal axis, just like the kayak.

This transformation involves scaling down in size but no orientation change, which is not the same as the transformation with the kayak.

- Transformation (B) shows that the first and second guitars remain the same in size and appearance. In the third image, the orientation of the guitar is changed; it is flipped once horizontally, similar to the kayak's transformation. This matches the transformation pattern of the kayak above.

- Transformation (C) includes a change in the orientation for each step, which does not match the kayak's pattern where there is no change between the first and second images.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it follows the same transformation rule: maintaining the orientation from the first to the second image and then changing the orientation from the second to the third image.",0,2DRotation180

  - Option (A) shows a guitar that is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from left to right.
  - Option (B) shows two guitars, the right one being smaller than the left one, indicating a change in size.
  - Option (C) shows the same guitar on the left, while the guitar on the right is smaller and rotated 90 degrees clockwise, indicating a combination of changes in size and orientation.

Comparing the transformations:

- The kayak undergoes a mirror flip (180-degree rotation along the vertical axis), so we are looking for a flip that gives a mirror image of the original, not just any rotation.
- Option (A) does not mirror flip but presents a 90-degree rotation clockwise, which is not the same as a 180-degree flip along the vertical axis.
- Option (B) does not involve a rotation or flip but instead shows a change in size.
- Option (C) combines a change in size with a rotation; however, although it includes a rotation, it does not involve the correct flip and introduces a size change that was not part of the top transformation.

1. Top Transformation (Butterfly): We observe that the butterfly is first shown with its wings closed, then with its wings open. Thus, the transformation involves a change in the orientation or position of the butterfly's wings.

2. Bottom Transformation (A) (Fox): The fox remains in an upright position with no change in orientation or position of its body parts; the difference is in the number of foxes presented.

3. Bottom Transformation (B) (Fox): The fox appears first facing to the left, then it is shown flipped upside down in the second image. This corresponds to a change in the orientation of the fox.

4. Bottom Transformation (C) (Fox): The fox undergoes a change in the number of body parts visible—a disassembled version of the fox appears in the second image.

By comparing the transformations, we can see that the change in the orientation of the butterfly's wings matches the change in the orientation of the fox in option (B).

3. Option (B) shows a transformation where the object is distorted and twisted, which also does not match the rotation in the top transformation.
4. Option (C) shows two identical images of a fox that are simply rotated relative to each other, with no other changes. This matches the type of transformation seen with the butterfly on top.

- Option (B) shows a fox that first appears upright and is then rotated about 90 degrees clockwise in the second image, similar to the top transformation of the butterfly.
- Option (C) shows a fox that has also been flipped to appear upside down and also appears to have been mirrored along a vertical axis in the second image.

   - Transformation (B) shows the sandwich rotating counterclockwise, similar to the caterpillar on top. The top of the sandwich is initially facing upwards and then is facing to the right.
   - Transformation (C) shows a sandwich that has not only rotated but also has changed its horizontal alignment, which is not a characteristic seen in the top transformation.

3. Transformation (B) shows both a rotation and a duplication, with the two sandwiches oriented towards each other in a mirrored position, similar to the objects in the top transformation.

4. Transformation (C) shows a rotation and a change in size, with one sandwich appearing larger than the other, but no duplication or mirroring is present.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's look at the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle and then apply the same reasoning to find the matching transformation among the three options (A), (B), or (C) below it.

1. Top Transformation Analysis:
   - The object in the first image appears to be a fish, specifically a clownfish, with its characteristic orange and white colors.

   - (B) shows a sandwich that changes orientation from facing left to right, which is consistent with the transformation we observed at the top with the fish.
   - (C) displays two identical images of a sandwich with no change at all.

- Option (C) also shows a change in orientation, but it's a rotation of less than 180 degrees and not along the vertical axis, as the creature is still facing the viewer.

2. Now, let's analyze the three transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle to find the one that possesses the same transformation:

   - (A) shows two views of an object. The first view is somewhat angled from the front, and the second is slightly more to the side, but there is not a complete reversal from front to rear.
   - (B) shows two views of an object. The first view is from the front, and the second view is a complete turn to the back, similar to the top transformation.
   - (C) shows two views of an object, but both views are different angles from the side. There's no indication of a front-to-rear rotation.

To reason this out, let's look at each step and transformation process:

2. A Closer Look at the Options:
   - (A) shows a change in the orientation of the flowers; they rotate from left to right without any other apparent changes. It's just a simple rotation, similar to the croissant, but we have to check the other options as well.
   - (B) shows a change in the layout of the flowers; they move from an upright position to a horizontal position, but there's also a change in the number of flowers visible. The change in number makes it different from the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a change in the orientation as the flowers begin in an upright position and end up sideways. No change in color, size, or number is observed, just like the transformation with the croissant.

Given that (C) is the only transformation that involves a simple rotation without changes in number, color, or size, it matches the transformation on the top with the croissant. Options (A) and (B) do not match because (A) represents a mere simple rotation without a change in perspective, and (B) is disqualified due to the change in the number of visible elements.

Top Transformation:
- The left image shows a croissant with its ends pointing leftward, and the right image shows the same croissant with its ends now pointing rightward. The croissant has been rotated or flipped along a vertical axis.

Now let's look at each option on the bottom:
- Option (A) shows a bunch of marigold flowers. In the first image, the flowers are pointing upwards, and in the second image, the flowers maintain the same configuration but are rotated to point to the right. This rotation is analogous to the rotation of the croissant in the top transformation.
- Option (B) shows significantly fewer flowers in the second image, suggesting a change in the number of objects, which does not match the top transformation process.
- Option (C) also depicts a change in the number of flowers as well as their orientation. The second image has fewer flowers compared to the first, and they have been rotated to point downwards.

Since option (A) is the only one that reflects a simple rotation or flipping along a vertical axis without any changes in number, size, or color of the object, it matches the transformation observed in the croissant at the top. Therefore, the correct answer is:

   - (C) involves the gingerbread man changing its orientation from standing upright to lying on its side without any other changes, matching the dinosaur's transformation above.

(C) The snowman repeats the same position in the first and third frames, but in the middle frame, one of its snowballs appears in a different position. This doesn't match the top transformation since the hand truck is flipped upside down in its middle state.

(C) The first object in sequence C is upright. The objects in the second and third frames remain upright, with no changes in orientation. This sequence does not match the top transformation.

Based on the analysis, the sequence of changes seen in the transformation of the objects in the bottom row marked (B) is the same as the changes seen in the transformation at the top of the puzzle; thus, the answer is (B).",0,2DRotation180
46,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

To reason through this step-by-step:

1. The transformation at the top shows a figure rotating along the horizontal axis. From left to right, the figure starts upright, then is flipped so that the head points towards the right, and finally ends upside down.

2. We must find a similar sequence of transformations among the three options (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom:
   - Option (A) shows two identical pawn objects, with no transformation applied.
   - Option (B) shows a pawn rotating in a similar manner to the figure at the top: from left to right, the pawn is first upright, then turned on its side (so that the top points towards the right), and ends upside down.
   - Option (C) shows a pawn that is upright in the first image and then transformed into two separate parts in the second image. This doesn't match the top transformation, which involves rotation and not separation.

3. Upon comparing the changes, (B) is the only option which follows a consistent rotation similar to the top transformation, hence it is the correct answer.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We start by analyzing the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle. Here, we have a cabinet that is initially closed and then opens up. The transformation involves a change in orientation (from closed to open).

- Now let's assess the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle for each of the options:

(A) Shows a teddy bear that is initially sitting and then flips upside down in orientation.
(B) Shows a teddy bear that is initially sitting and then has one of its arms move to a different position, which appears to resemble the open door of the cabinet.
(C) Shows two identical teddy bears, with no change in orientation, number, or color. Only the position of the teddy bears relative to each other is different, which is not one of the changes we're looking for.

- The transformation in (B) matches the transformation at the top with a change in orientation that is analogous to the cabinet door's movement. The bear's arm, similar to the cabinet door, moves from a closed position to an open position.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",1,2DRotation+90
47,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(A)

Let's go through the transformations step by step:

Top Transformation: The object, which appears to be a cabinet, transforms from a closed state to an open state. What we’re observing is a change in orientation, where the front-facing closed cabinet reveals the inside compartments when opened.

Bottom Transformations:
- (A) This sequence shows a stuffed animal transitioning from a front-facing, seated position to a back-facing, prone position. This transformation includes a change in orientation of the object.
- (B) This sequence shows the same stuffed animal transitioning from a seated front-facing position to a seated position rotated 90 degrees to its side. The transformation is a change in orientation, but not in a manner similar to the top transformation.
- (C) Here, the stuffed animal transitions from a seated front-facing position to a rotated upside-down position. This transformation also includes a change in orientation, but once more, it is not similar to the top transformation.

Given the options, (A) is the one that most closely parallels the top transformation where the orientation of the object changes to reveal a different aspect (the back of the stuffed animal, similar to the inside of the cabinet).

Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",1,2DRotation+90
47,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the transformation of the object on top. You can see that the object, a shoe rack, has changed from being closed to being open.

2. Now let's compare this to the three sets of transformations at the bottom of the puzzle. We are looking for a similar change, one that involves an opening or revealing of something that was previously not visible.

- Transformation (A) shows a plush toy that has flipped over on its side. This is not the same as opening, so (A) is not the correct match.
- Transformation (B) shows the same plush toy sitting normally and then in the next image it has its back exposed, which reveals a previously unseen backside. This is similar to the shoe rack which opened to reveal the inside.
- Transformation (C) shows the plush toy first sitting normally and then upside down. While this does reveal a new side of the toy, it's not an 'opening' transformation but rather a rotation.

3. The correct answer is (B) because both the shoe rack on top and the plush toy in transformation (B) have undergone a revealing or uncovering change from one image to the next.",0,No change
48,0,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, examine the top transformation of the object which is a submarine. It goes from being horizontal and pointing to the right to being vertical and pointing upwards. This is a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise.
  
- Now, look at the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) to find a similar pattern of change:

  (A) The fish is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the first to the second image. This is not the same transformation as the one at the top of the puzzle.

  (B) The fish is flipped horizontally (a reflection) from the first to the second image. This is also not the same transformation as the one at the top of the puzzle.

  (C) The fish rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise from the first to the second image, which matches the rotation of the submarine at the top of the puzzle.

Therefore, the correct analogy to the transformation at the top of the puzzle is found in (C).",0,2DRotation180
48,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- On the top of the puzzle, we have a simple shape changing its orientation from horizontal to vertical between the first and second images. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects.

- Option (A) shows a change in orientation and position of the fish while maintaining the same size and color. However, the presence of two images suggests an extra level of transformation not present in the original pattern.

- Option (B) shows a change in the orientation of the fish, as it has been rotated 90 degrees to face upward. There is no change in the number, size, or color of the fish, which closely resembles the change in the top transformation.

- Option (C) shows an identical transformation to the top one, as the fish is turned from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation without changing its size, color, or quantity, which perfectly matches the transformation observed in the top images.

Thus, the transformation that matches the top of the puzzle is (C), because it is the only option that solely involves a change in the orientation of the object without altering any other properties.",0,No change
48,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

To solve this visual puzzle, we'll assess the transformation that occurs from the left image to the right image in the top row and look for a corresponding transformation in the options given below.

Top row transformation analysis:
1. The object (a submarine) appears horizontal on the left.
2. On the right, the submarine is oriented vertically and is pointing upwards.
3. The change is an orientation (rotation) change from horizontal to vertical.

Now, let's look at the transformations in the bottom row:

(A) In the first box, the fish is oriented diagonally, facing up and to the right. In the second box, the fish is still oriented diagonally but is facing down and to the right. This represents a change in orientation but not in the same way as the top transformation — the fish is rotated around a different axis.

(B) In the first box, the fish is oriented horizontally, facing to the right. In the second box, the fish is oriented vertically and is facing upwards. This is the same kind of transformation (rotation) as the top row — from horizontal to vertical.

(C) In the first box, the fish is oriented diagonally, facing up and to the left. In the second box, the fish is still oriented diagonally but facing down and to the left. Similar to option (A), there is a change in orientation, but it is not the same as the top transformation.

Since option (B) mirrors",0,2DRotation180
49,0,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation (ship image), we notice that the transformation involves a rotation. The ship starts upright and then flips 90 degrees to become sideways in the second image.

2. Now, let's analyze the transformations in the options (A), (B), and (C).

- In option (A), we see that the object (which appears to be some sort of knob or handle) simply moves from left to right without any change in orientation or other properties.
  
- In option (B), the object undergoes a transformation that involves a 90-degree rotation along its longitudinal axis similar to the ship—starting from an upright position and ending in a sideways position.
  
- In option (C), the object appears to get pulled out or extended from its base as it moves from left to right, altering its length rather than rotating.

3. Comparing the transformations, the change exhibited in option (B) matches the transformation of the ship on the top, which is a 90-degree rotation along the axis suggested by the perspective of the viewer. Therefore, (B) is the option that has the same type of transformation as the one on top.",0,2DRotation180
49,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- For the objects on top (a pirate ship), the transformation from left to right shows the ship tilting to the right.
- Now, looking at the options (A), (B), and (C):
  - (A) shows a satellite rotating in a way that its central body is turning towards us while maintaining its orientation (antennas facing the same direction).
  - (B) shows the satellite tilting to the right, which is similar to the way the ship tilts to the right. The orientation change is consistent in both transformations.
  - (C) not only has the satellite tilting but also shows it flipping upside down, which is not a transformation we see in the ship.

The transformation in (B) matches the initial transformation of the ship best, as both involve a simple tilt to the right without any flips or other changes in orientation beyond the tilt.",0,No change
49,2,0,+90,0,90,180,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, it shows a ship being sliced in half from front to back with the front half of the ship remaining in the second image. The change here is about the separation and removal of a part of the object.

2. Now, let's analyze the transformations at the bottom:

- Option (A) shows a satellite dish facing left and then facing right with no change in its structure or the removal of parts. This is a simple rotation, so option (A) does not match the ship transformation.
- Option (B) shows a satellite dish that first appears intact and then appears cut in half with the bottom half missing in the second image. This mirrors the transformation at the top where a part of the object is removed.
- Option (C) shows a satellite dish facing left and then the same satellite dish but tilted upward with no change in its structure or the removal of parts. This is another simple rotation, so option (C) does not match the ship transformation.

Based on the analysis, option (B) is the only transformation that involves removing a part of the object as seen with the ship on the top of the puzzle.",0,2DRotation180
