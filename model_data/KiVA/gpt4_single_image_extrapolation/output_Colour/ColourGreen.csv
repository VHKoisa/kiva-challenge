The transformation in this visual puzzle involves a change in color. On the top, there is a dog that changes color from blue to green without any other alterations to its shape, size, or orientation. We will analyze each of the three transformations on the bottom to determine which matches this type of transformation:

- (A) shows a purple fruit that remains the same in the second image, so there is no transformation here.
- (B) shows a purple fruit that changes color to orange in the second image while retaining its shape, size, and orientation, which matches the type of transformation seen on the top with the dog.
- (C) shows a purple fruit changing color to green in the second image, but it also changes its type from the initial fruit to a different one, so this does not match the top transformation where only the color changes.

Based on this analysis, transformation (B) is the correct answer because it involves only a change in color, just like the transformation on the top of the puzzle.",0,ColourRed
0,1,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"(B)

Let's solve this visual puzzle step-by-step by comparing the top transformation with the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:
1. The first image on the top shows a purple dog facing left.
2. The second image on the top shows the same dog in green facing right.

Change Observed:
- Color changed from purple to green.
- Orientation flipped from facing left to facing right.

Now let's analyze the bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C):

(A) Transformation:
1. The first image shows a purple orange slice.
2. The second image shows a green apple half.

Changes Observed:
- The color changes from purple to green, which matches the top transformation.
- The type of fruit changes from an orange to an apple, which does not match the top transformation since the dog's species did not change.
- Since there is a change in object type that does not match the top transformation, we can eliminate option (A).

(B) Transformation:
1. The first image shows a purple orange slice.
2. The second image shows an orange orange slice.

Changes Observed:
- The color changes from purple to orange, which does not match the color change in the top transformation (purple to green).
- However, the orientation changes since the orange slice has been rotated 180 degrees to show the other side, but it's facing the same direction, which is not a match to the top transformation where the dog has",0,ColourRed
0,2,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (B).

To arrive at this conclusion, let's evaluate the top transformation shown in the puzzle and then compare it to each of the three bottom transformations (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:
- The left image shows a purple dog.
- The right image shows the same dog in green.

The transformation involves a change in color from purple to green.

Now let's analyze each of the bottom transformations:

(A) Transformation:
- The left image shows a purple fruit (possibly a citrus fruit like an orange).
- The right image shows the fruit in orange color.
This transformation involves a change in color, but from purple to orange, not purple to green.

(B) Transformation:
- The left image shows a purple fruit.
- The right image shows the fruit in green color.
This transformation involves the same change as the one on top - a color change from purple to green.

(C) Transformation:
- The left image shows a purple fruit.
- The right image also shows a purple fruit, with the number of fruits having increased from one to two.
The transformation here involves a change in number, not color.

After evaluating all the transformations, we can see that (B) is the only transformation that matches the type of transformation seen with the dog on top, which is a change in color from purple to green.",1,ColourGreen
1,0,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Top Transformation: The transformation involves a change in the color of the object. The object changes from blue to green from left to right.

2. Transformation (A): The change here involves a shift in the color of the object, from a purple container with purple fries to an orange container with orange fries. However, the object also changes shape—the container goes from a box to a cone.

3. Transformation (B): There is no change visible in this transformation. The object, a purple container with purple fries, remains the same in both the left and right images.

4. Transformation (C): This transformation shows a change in color, from purple to green, while the shape of the object—a container with fries—remains the same.

The only transformation that matches the top transformation is (C), where the color changes from purple to green without any other properties of the object changing.",1,ColourGreen
1,1,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top transformation:
   - The object is a fan, and the transformation involves a change in both color (from blue to green) and orientation (the fan is flipped).

2. Compare this transformation to each of the options (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:
   - Option (A) shows a set of fingers in a box, changing color from purple to red and flipping orientation from one side to the other.
   - Option (B) shows the same fingers in a box, only changing color from purple to red, without flipping orientation.
   - Option (C) shows the fingers in a box, changing color from purple to green without changing orientation.

3. Match transformations:
   - Option (A) matches the top transformation because it involves both a color change and a flip in orientation, just like the transformation of the fan from blue to green and upside down.
   - Options (B) and (C) do not match because they do not involve a change in orientation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it mirrors the top transformation by changing color and flipping orientation.",0,ColourRed

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation presented on the top and compare it with each of the options provided on the bottom.

Top transformation: We start with a blue fan, and the transformation involves changing its color to green. There is no change in size, orientation, or number of objects.

Now let's examine the transformations on the bottom:

- (A) shows a transformation from a blue set of fries to a red set of fries. This is a color change, similar to the top transformation.
- (B) presents a transformation where only the container of the fries changes color from blue to red. The fries themselves do not change color. This is not the same transformation as the top.
- (C) depicts a transformation from a blue set of fries in a blue container to a green set of fries in a green container. This involves a full object color change, not just the fries as in the top transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) since it is the only one among the choices that exhibits a similar color change transformation while keeping the other variables (size, orientation, number) constant, as seen in the top transformation.",0,ColourRed

To solve this visual puzzle, we'll analyze the transformation at the top and then apply the same logic to the three options provided at the bottom to find the match.

The transformation at the top shows a rocking horse that changes from blue to green from left to right. The only change is in color; no other attributes of size, orientation, or number are affected.

Now let's apply this to the transformations at the bottom:

(A) This shows a basket of blue flowers changing to a basket with red flowers, along with the basket's top border changing from blue to red.
(B) This shows a basket with blue flowers and a blue border. The change is only in the color of the basket's border, which changes from blue to green, while the color of the flowers remains blue.
(C) This shows two identical baskets with blue flowers and a blue border, with no change, meaning no transformation at all.

The transformation in (B) matches the top transformation, where only the color of a single part (the top border of the basket instead of the whole object) changes, with the rest of the object remaining unchanged. Transformations (A) and (C) do not match because (A) has multiple color changes, and (C) has no change at all.",1,ColourGreen

Now let's go through the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation of the object:
   - The left object is a blue rocking horse.
   - The right object is a green rocking horse.

2. The transformation involved:
   - There is a change in color from blue to green.

3. Now, checking the transformations at the bottom for (A), (B), and (C):
   - (A) shows no change between the objects—they remain the same color and design.
   - (B) shows a change in color from blue to green, just as in the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a change from blue to red, which is not the same as the top transformation.

4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only transformation that matches the type of change observed in the top transformation, which is a change in color from blue to green.",1,ColourGreen

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation that occurs from the left to the right object in the top sequence and then compare it with the transformations in the sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) below.

Top sequence transformation:
- The rocking horse changes color from blue to green.
- No change in size, orientation, or number is observed.

Now, let's analyze the bottom sequences:

(A) The basket remains blue throughout the sequence. No change in color, size, orientation, or number.
(B) The basket changes color from blue to green, similar to the transformation of the rocking horse on top. No change in size, orientation, or number.
(C) The basket changes color from blue to red, not the same color transformation as the one on top.

Based on this, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only sequence in which the object undergoes the same color change transformation as the object on the top of the puzzle, which is from one color to another (blue to green).",1,ColourGreen

  - (B) shows a cluster of grapes changing color from blue to green.
  - (C) does not involve any color change; it shows the same cluster of grapes with blue color in both images.
  
- Since the top transformation involves a change in color and (B) is the only sequence on the bottom that involves a change to the same color as the top transformation (from original color to green), (B) is the correct answer.",1,ColourGreen

  - (A) shows a change from blue to red (color change) and a change in the number of attachments (from 3 to 2).
  - (B) shows no change in color (both are blue), but there is a change in the number of attachments (from 3 to 2).
  - (C) shows a change from blue to green (color change) without any changes in size, orientation, number, or shape—just like the transformation on the top.

Thus, (C) matches the transformation pattern seen on the top, which is solely a change in color.",1,ColourGreen

To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the top transformation feature by feature and then match it to the correct set of transformations from (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom:

Top Transformation:
1. The object changes color from purple with light purple dots to green with light green dots.
2. The handle/stem of the object changes color from purple to green.
3. The rest of the object remains the same in shape and pattern.

Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom:

(A) Shows the same object with no changes whatsoever between the two images. There's no color change or any other transformation. This does not match the top transformation.

(B) Shows the object changing color from purple to red, while the attached leaves change color from blue to brown. This mirrors the behavior in the top transformation where both the object and its handle/stem change color, even though the exact colors are different.

(C) Has the object changing from purple to green, which is the same kind of transformation as the top object regarding the color change. However, the attached leaves do not change color, they stay blue, which is not consistent with the top transformation wherein the handle/stem also changes color.

Considering the consistencies in type of change, option (B) is the closest match, as it shows a color change in both parts of the object, matching the top transformation even though the specific colors are different.",0,ColourRed
4,0,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the choice:

- The top transformation shows a purple object changing to green, with the overall shape remaining the same. Thus, the transformation involves a change in color.

Now let's examine the transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

- (A) shows a blue mouse turning into a green mouse, which represents a change in color, similar to the top transformation. However, the position of the tail also changes its direction slightly, which is an additional transformation not present in the top one.
  
- (B) shows no change at all between the two images of the blue mouse. Therefore, this option does not match the top transformation.

- (C) depicts a blue mouse turning into a red mouse with the shape and orientation remaining consistent. This denotes only a change in color, precisely matching the type of transformation seen on the top.

   - Transformation (B) shows a color change from blue to green.
   - Transformation (C) shows no change at all; the object remains blue.

3. The transformation seen in choice (B) on the bottom is the same type of transformation observed at the top—the object changes color from one to another.

3. Transformation (A) keeps the color consistent (both mice are purple), so it does not match the top transformation.

4. Transformation (B) changes the color of the object from purple to green, which matches the type of transformation seen on top.

5. Transformation (C) changes the color from purple to red, which, while it is a color change, is not the same color change as the top transformation (purple to green).

   - The object in the middle has changed color from blue to red while retaining the same orientation and shape.
   - The object on the right has then changed color from red to green, while again retaining the same orientation and shape.

2. Now observe the transformations for options (A), (B), and (C):

   - (B) shows a plum changing color from purple to blue, and then in the next image, it changes to a third color, green.
   - (C) shows a plum changing color from purple to blue, but then in the next image, it reverts back to the original purple color before changing to green.

   - (A) shows the same object (a plum) in three different panels, with no change in size, orientation, number, or color.
   - (B) shows a purple plum changing into a red plum and then back to a purple plum. Here, there is a change in color.
   - (C) shows a blue plum changing into a green plum, just like the canoe on top, but the process is not analogous because the plum reverts back to blue; this is an additional transformation not present in the canoe's transformation.

3. The only transformation in the options that matches the top sequence in terms of a single change in color (and only color) without additional changes is option (B), where the plum goes from purple to red, then back to purple.

   - Option (B) shows a plum changing from purple to red and then back to purple.
   - Option (C) shows a plum changing from purple to green.

3. The transformation that best matches the top puzzle is the color change.

4. The only option that exhibits a color change is option (B), as it changes from one color (purple) to a different color (red) and then back to the original color (purple), similar to how the boat on top changes from blue to green and potentially back to blue if the pattern were to continue.

   - Transformation (B) shows a consistent change in color from red to green without any other apparent changes.
   - Transformation (C) shows a change in color from red to green but also a change in the texture of the object, with the left object having a rough texture and the right object having a smooth texture.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we notice that the change is a color change from orange to green.
2. Option (A) shows a change in both color (from red to green) and orientation (the object has turned to face a different direction). This can be observed as the red object's left side transitions to the green object's right side.
3. Option (B) exhibits only a color change from red to orange, which is a similar change in attribute (color) but not the exact colors as the transformation at the top.
4. Option (C) shows a color change from red to blue, as well as a duplication for multiplication in the number of objects, from one to two.
5. As only option (B) involves a change solely in color without any other transformation such as orientation change or multiplication, it is the one that corresponds most closely to the color-only transformation shown at the top of the puzzle.

The transformation involves a change in the color of both the body and the shell of the turtle.

2. Now, let's analyze the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C).

   - (A) shows a red donut with red sprinkles transforming into a green donut with green sprinkles. This option involves a change in the color of both the donut and the sprinkles, similar to the turtle's body and shell color change.
   
   - (B) shows a red donut with yellow sprinkles transforming into a purple donut with blue sprinkles. Here, there's a change in the color of the donut and the sprinkles independently, which aligns with the color change in the turtle—its body and shell change to different colors.
   
   - (C) shows two identical images of a red donut with yellow sprinkles, indicating no change at all.

To solve the visual puzzle, let's consider the transformation that happens to the object at the top of the puzzle:

1. The object is a toy turtle, and the transformation involves a change in color. The toy turtle changes from an orange body and purple shell to a green body and green shell. The pattern on the shell also changes color and becomes less distinct, blending in with the rest of the shell. 

Now, let's examine the transformations for each set of objects at the bottom of the puzzle marked (A), (B), and (C):

A) The red donut changes to a purple donut. While this is a color change, the type of change is not consistent with the turtle transformation. The turtle changes to a color where both parts—the body and the shell—become the same color, eliminating the contrast between them. This is not the case for the donut.

B) The red donut changes to another red donut with slightly different sprinkles. This alteration is subtle, similar to how the turtle's shell pattern changes subtly by blending with the shell color.

C) The red donut changes to a brown donut with a change in the sprinkles' color. The entire donut changes color, but this is a complete color change for the whole object, not a subtle blend of patterns and colors as with the turtle's shell.

   - In (C), the plane retains its color, but there is a change in orientation between the images, which does not match the top transformation since the piano does not change in orientation.

10,0,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (B).

To solve this visual puzzle, we observe the transformation occurring from left to right in the top row, then apply the observed rules of transformation to the bottom three options to determine which one follows the same pattern.

Top Row Transformation:
1. Color change: The color of the object changes from purple to green.
2. Orientation change: The object does not change its orientation; it remains the same.
3. Size change: The size of the object remains constant.
4. Number change: There is no change in the number of objects.

Now, we apply these findings to the three options below:

(A) No color change (both objects are blue), therefore option (A) cannot be correct.

(B) Color change from blue to red: This matches the color change observed in the top row, from purple to green.
The orientation of the object remains the same, consistent with the pattern shown in the top row.
The size of the object does not change, which is also true for the top row transformation.
There is no change in the number of objects, in line with the top row.

(C) Color change from blue to green, which might seem correct at first. However, notice that the size of the object changes from a larger version to a smaller version. This is not in line with the top row transformation, where the size remains constant.

Therefore, the only option that fulfills all the conditions observed in the transformation of the top row is option (",0,ColourRed

Let's analyze the visual puzzle step-by-step:

1. The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows a piece of cake with purple layers and a purple topping that changes color to green layers and a brown topping. This indicates that the transformation involves a change in color.

2. Now let's look at the transformations for each of the three objects at the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C).
   - (A) shows an object that retains its blue color in both images.
   - (B) shows an object that changes color from blue to green.
   - (C) shows an object that changes color from blue to red.

3. The only transformation that matches the one on the top is (B), where the object changes color from one image to the next. The top transformation changes from purple to green, similarly, option (B) changes from blue to green.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only option where the object's transformation involves a change in color, which matches the transformation type of the object on the top.",1,ColourGreen
10,2,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"(C)

To solve the visual puzzle, let's carefully examine the transformation that happens from left to right in the top object and then apply that analysis to determine which transformation (A), (B), or (C) follows the same pattern.

Top Transformation Analysis:
1. Cake slice color changes from blue to green.
2. The strawberry on top of the cake changes from purple to brown.
3. The direction of the cake slice and the positioning of the strawberry remain the same.
4. There are no changes in the number of objects or the size.

Now let's look at the transformations in the options (A), (B), and (C) to find the matching pattern.

(A) Transformation:
- Changes from blue to green.
- Orientation and size remain constant.
- The pattern of color change matches the top transformation, but we need to examine the other options to ensure a match across all aspects.

(B) Transformation:
- The orientation of the shape changes (the object is flipped).
- The color remains constant (blue).
- This does not match the top transformation because the orientation changes whereas in the top transformation, the orientation stays the same.

(C) Transformation:
- Changes from blue to red.
- Orientation and size remain constant.
- The pattern of a single color change matches the top transformation's pattern of changing colors without altering orientation or size.

Given these observations, the correct answer is (C). It matches the transformation on top by changing the color of the object without altering the size",0,ColourRed
11,0,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, we observe that the object changes from red to green, and the red protrusions turn to gold. Therefore, we're looking for a transformation on the bottom that involves a change in color.

2. In option (A), the object changes color from a multicolored top with red at the topmost section and dark brown at the bottom-most to a single-colored green with dark brown remaining at the bottom-most section. This does not match the top transformation since the object in (A) still retains the dark brown section, which does not correlate with the color change in the protrusions in the top example.

3. In option (B), the object changes color from multicolored with red at the topmost section to the same multicolored scheme but with the red now at the bottom. Thus, this option accounts for a change in the order of the colors rather than a complete color change as seen in the top transformation.

4. In option (C), the object changes color from multicolored with red, orange, and brown segments to a single-colored scheme with gradations of blue to purple. This color change from multicolored to one color with a gradient is analogous to the top transformation, which switches from solid red to a solid green and alters the protrusions from red to gold.

Therefore, option (C) is the one that matches the left-to-right transformation on the",0,ColourBlue

The visual puzzle presents a transformation in the objects which involves a change in color and shape. The transformation between the first and second object on the top shows that the object changes from red to green and it appears that the shape also changes slightly, particularly the inner structures are changing color (from orange to yellow) and position.

Let's now analyze the transformations of the objects marked (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:

- (A) shows a caterpillar changing color from a combination of red, orange, brown, and purple to a combination of purple, blue, and darker blue. However, there is no structural change, only a color change, similar to the top transformation.
- (B) displays a caterpillar that keeps the same colors in each segment but rotates to display a different side, changing the visible order of colors. This does not match the top transformation as there is no color change, just a rotation.
- (C) shows a caterpillar that changes color from red, orange, and brown with a green head to green, dark green, and brown with a brown head. This transformation involves a color change, like the one on the top, but there's also a significant shape change as the segments merge into each other in the transformation, which is not observed in the top transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it includes a color change without a structural or positional change, matching the transformation observed in the top objects.",0,ColourBlue
11,2,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

Looking at the top transformation, we see two steps:

1. The object changes from one color to another (from a shade of red to green).
2. The orientation of the colored parts on the object also changes (the red/orange parts on the left turn to green/yellow on the right).

Now, let's compare with the options below:

(A) Shows a change in the orientation of the colored sections; the colors of the individual sections do not change, only their order does. This does not match the transformation seen on the top as there is no color change.

(B) Sho𝚠s a simple rotation with no change in color or rearrangement of colored sections. This does not match the transformation on the top.

(C) Shows a change in both the color (the colors of the segments change from the left to the right image) and the orientation of the colored sections (the order of the colored segments also changes). This matches the transformation seen on the top, which involves both a color change and a change in the arrangement of the colored parts.

Thus, (C) is the only transformation that exhibits the same change type as the transformation at the top - both color and arrangement of features.",1,ColourGreen
12,0,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (C). Let's go through the step-by-step reasoning:

Top Transformation:
- We can observe that the object on top is a three-layered piece with two colors. The left object has the color order of red on top and orange at the bottom. Through the transformation, the object on the right maintains its shape and number of layers, but the color order is reversed with green on top and a darker green at the bottom.

Bottom Transformations:
- Option (A) shows an Adirondack chair changing from red to blue but not reversing in any particular way.
- Option (B) shows a color change from red to green, but instead of just a simple color inversion or order reversal, it seems to rotate or transform the object.
- Option (C) shows two red Adirondack chairs with no changes in their properties, so there is no transformation at all.

We are looking for a transformation that mirrors what happened on top, specifically the inversion or reversal of the colors while maintaining the shape and number. Since (A) and (B) altered either the orientation or the color in a different way, they are not correct. Although (C) doesn't show a visible transformation, it is the only option that keeps the sequence exactly the same from left to right, just like the top transformation maintains the number and shape of the object while changing its color properties. Therefore, by process of elimination and matching the type of change, (C) is",0,No change
12,1,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a brick changing colors from left to right: red/orange to green, with the orange stripe remaining constant.

2. Let's examine the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a red chair changing to blue and then returning to red. This is not the same transformation because the color returns to the original instead of changing to a new color.
   - (B) shows a red chair changing to a different shade of red and then changing to green. This matches the pattern of changing to a new color observed in the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a red chair changing to a darker red and then to green. However, the green chair is a lighter green compared to the dark green brick on top, so the shade of green does not match the pattern exactly.

Therefore, option (B) is the closest match to the top transformation because it shows a change in color similar to the one observed with the bricks, despite the absence of a constant feature like the orange stripe in the top transformation.",0,No change
12,2,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"(B)

Let's analyze the transformation of the object on the top first:

1. The object starts as red with a lighter red stripe.
2. It then changes entirely to a lighter red color.
3. It finally changes color again, turning green with a darker green stripe.

Now, we'll apply similar logic to the transformations on the bottom:

- Transformation (A) starts with a red chair, changes to blue, and then to purple. This change in hue does not match the pattern we observed above.
- Transformation (B) starts with a red chair, then changes to a lighter red, and finally to green. This transformation follows the same pattern of color change as the object on the top.
- Transformation (C) starts with a red chair, changes to a lighter red but then to a different shade of green than the starting red. The final shade of green does not contain a darker green stripe as the green object on the top does.

Therefore, the transformation that matches is (B), because the object changes color first to a lighter version of itself and then to a completely different color, which is consistent with the top transformation.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, you can see the transformation of an object (a train) that involves changing colors from left to right. The train changes from purple to green.

2. Option (A) shows two identical figures in terms of color and orientation; there is no change between the left and the right images.

3. Option (B) exhibits a change in color from left to right, from purple to green, which matches the type of transformation seen in the top example with the train.

4. Option (C) shows a change in color as well, but it transitions from purple to orange, which is different from the purple to green color change in the top example.

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer because it is the only option that demonstrates the same type of transformation as the object on the top of the puzzle (a change in color from purple to green).",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation on the top features a two-stage change, involving both color and orientation: The object (train) goes from a purple color and facing one direction to a green color and being rotated to face the opposite direction.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C), we need to identify which one shows the same kind of changes: a color change and an orientation change.

3. Option (A) shows no change at all; the object (figure) remains with the same color and orientation in both the left and right images.

4. Option (B) shows the figure changing from a purple color to a green color and also demonstrates an orientation change, where the figure's wardrobe is rotated, showcasing different-colored clothing at the front in the two images.

5. Option (C) only exhibits a color change; the orientation remains the same.

6. Since option (B) is the only one that includes both a change in color and a change in orientation, it is the correct choice that matches the type of transformation displayed on the top.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the top of the puzzle, the transformation involves a change in color. The object (train) changes from purple to green while maintaining the same size, orientation, and number of objects.

2. Now, examining the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle marked with (A), (B), and (C):
   - (A) shows a color change from purple to green, similar to the transformation at the top.
   - (B) shows a color change as well, but not only does the color of the object (the person) change from purple and blue to orange and red, the orientation also changes slightly as the left arm is in a different position.
   - (C) displays no color change, just an increase in the number of objects, which is different from the single object color change at the top of the puzzle.

3. By elimination, option (B) is the correct answer as it involves a change in the color of the object while the orientation (except for the left arm) and size remain unchanged. Although the slight change in the left arm's position in (B) might seem to disqualify it, this is the most similar transformation to that at the top of the puzzle when compared to (A) and (C). Therefore, (B) is the most appropriate match because the primary transformation--a complete color change--is present, despite the minor difference in arm position.",0,ColourRed
14,0,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The top transformation shows a single figure changing color from left to right; the figure goes from being all blue on the left to all purple on the right.
- The transformation labeled (A) shows a figure changing from blue and white to red and yellow from left to right. This transformation involves a change in color, similar to the top transformation.
- The transformation labeled (B) shows a change in color but also a change in orientation, as the figure is rotated from the left image to the right image. This does not match the top transformation, which involves only a color change without rotation.
- The transformation labeled (C) also shows a figure changing color from blue and white on the left to green and yellow on the right, but there is also a change in orientation, as the figure is shown from a different perspective in the right image. This does not match the top transformation, which involves only a color change without rotation.

- In option (A), there's also a change in color from the left object to the right object, going from completely blue to red with portions of blue. This matches the type of transformation in the top part of the puzzle.
- In option (B), the change involves a complete change in color from blue to green, with no parts retained from the original color. This does not match the transformation in the top part of the puzzle, where parts of the original color are retained.
- In option (C), no change occurs between the left and right objects; they remain exactly the same.

   (C) From left to right, the figure changes color and doubles in number, which does not correspond with the type of change on the top.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation that happens from left to right in each sequence.

For the top sequence with the bench-like objects, we observe the following changes:
1. Color: The color changes from blue to green.
2. Orientation: The object rotates, resulting in a different perspective being shown.

Now we can compare these changes to the sequences labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle.

(A) This sequence shows a change in color from purple to green. But there is no change in orientation or perspective between the two images.
(B) This sequence shows a change in color from purple to blue, and there is a change in orientation or perspective, as the first plum is oriented with the stem on top and it appears we are viewing it from a slightly higher angle, while the second plum is oriented with the stem on the left and appears to be viewed from a more lateral or side angle. 
(C) This sequence shows a change in color from purple to orange and a change in size, as the second object appears smaller than the first. There's no change in orientation or perspective between the two images.

The sequence that best matches the top transformation in terms of the types of changes is sequence (B), where both color and orientation are altered.",0,No change

- (A) shows a plum changing color from blue to orange.
- (B) shows a plum changing color from purple to green.
- (C) shows two plums that are both purple, meaning there is no change.

Step 3: The only bottom transformation that matches the type of change (a change in color only) displayed in the top transformation is:
- (B) as it is the only example where the object changes color without any other transformations like size, orientation, or number.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) because it shows a plum changing color from one to another, which is analogous to the sled changing color on the top of the puzzle.",1,ColourGreen

2. The second image on the top row features a green cup with a slightly different design inside it.

Top Transformation:
1. The coffee cup changes color from purple to green.
2. There are visible patterns in the coffee (presumably coffee art), and while the color changes, the pattern remains consistent.

Now let's analyze the bottom transformations:

Option (A):
1. The color of the frog changes from blue to orange, a clear change in color.
2. There is no additional detail or pattern in the frogs that we can say stays consistent through the transformation.

Option (B):

Option (C):
1. The color of the frog changes from blue to green, matching the color change in the top transformation.
2. There is no additional detail or pattern in the frogs that we can say stays consistent through the transformation.

Upon close examination, none of the transformations on the bottom follows the exact transformation pattern seen at the top because none of them maintains a pattern or feature consistent between the color change.

(C) shows a change in the size of the frog, with the second frog being smaller than the first. There are no other changes, so the transformation type is not consistent with the top row's color change.

- For (B), there is a color change from blue to red, which does not match the color change in the hats.

(C) The transformation involves a change in color (blue to red) but also includes a change in orientation, which is not present in the top transformation.

- (B) shows a red bucket changing into a green bucket and then back to a red bucket. Despite the similarity in the color change to what is seen on the top, this sequence involves a change back to the original color, which does not match the steady color change from the top.
- (C) shows two red buckets with no change in any variable.

Given this analysis, the transformation sequence that matches the one at the top is (A) because it's the only sequence in which there is a change in color, with no other variables changing.",0,ColourBlue

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle. We are shown a red ball that changes color to green from left to right. There are no changes in size, orientation, or number—only the color changes.

Now, let's examine the transformations of the objects at the bottom of the puzzle:

(A) Shows a red cauldron changing to a blue cauldron. This transformation involves a change in color.

(B) Shows a red cauldron changing to a green cauldron and then back to a red cauldron. This transformation involves a change in color and then a reversal back to the original color.

(C) Shows a red cauldron remaining the same color in both frames. There is no change in color, size, orientation, or number.

Considering the transformation at the top involves only a change in color, the only sequence at the bottom that has no change at all is (C), making it the only one that matches the type of transformation at the top, where there's only one consistent change (albeit a different type of change—color at the top, none at the bottom). Thus, the answer is (C) because none of the sequences (A), (B), or (C) exactly mimic the top transformation of a color change, and (C) represents a sequence without any changes, unlike (A) and (B) which have color changes.",0,No change

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

Looking at the transformation on the top of the puzzle, we see a blue candy that changes not only in color but also rotates and changes in shape to become a green candy.

Now, let's analyze the bottom transformations:

(A) shows a purple lizard that changes to an orange lizard. There is a change in color, but no rotation or shape change as with the candy.
(B) shows a blue lizard that rotates and changes its color to green, very similar to the transformation shown by the candy above.
(C) shows a blue lizard that changes its position but retains its color. There is no change in color or shape.

Therefore, the transformation of the lizard in (B) matches the transformation seen above with the candy – both objects rotate, change color, and there is a perceived alteration in shape due to the rotation.",1,ColourGreen
20,1,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (C).

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation patterns on the top first and then compare it to the options given at the bottom:

On the top, we see a candy being transformed from left to right. Here is the step-by-step analysis of the transformation:
- The candy changes from a blue color to a green color.
- The orientation of the candy remains the same.
- There is no change in size.
- The number of candies does not change.

Now let's take this analysis and apply it to the transformations of the objects at the bottom:
(A) The lizard changes from blue to orange: This matches the color change in the top transformation, but we need to check the other attributes too.
(B) The lizard changes from blue to green and rotates about 90 degrees to the left: This involves an additional transformation of orientation, which does not match the top transformation.
(C) The lizard changes from blue to green without any other alterations: This option matches the top transformation perfectly - color change without changes in size, orientation, or number.

Therefore, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation is (C) because it only involves a change in color without other alterations.",0,No change

Let's break down the transformation of the object on the top row first. There is a candy wrapped in a blue wrapper transforming into a candy wrapped in a green wrapper. The changes we observe here are as follows:
1. Color: The wrapper of the candy changes color from blue to green.
2. Pattern/Texture: The blue wrapper has solid color while the green wrapper has stripes/sections in a darker shade.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the options given in the bottom row:

(A) The first object is a blue lizard that transforms into an orange lizard. The change here is in color only, but it does not have a change in pattern or texture.
(B) The first object is a blue lizard with a solid color that transforms into an identical lizard in terms of shape and orientation but with a different color (blue to purple) and a pattern addition (solid to spotted).
(C) The first object is a blue lizard that transforms into a green lizard. The only change is the color, and there is no change in the pattern.

Option (B) has the same type of change as the top row with both a color switch and a pattern addition, matching the transformation sequence of the top object. The other options only demonstrate a change in color without any pattern addition. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.",0,No change

(A) A red cap turns into a purple cap. This is a change in color.
(B) A red cap turns into a green cap. This is also a change in color.
(C) A red cap turns into a red cap. There is no change at all.

The correct answer is (B) because it matches the transformation at the top, where only the color changes from red to green, and all other aspects of the object remain the same.",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We are looking for transformation properties in the top pair of images that match one of the three bottom pairs (A, B, or C). The top pair shows a red rose transforming into a green rose. The only change occurring here is in color, from red to green. The size, orientation, and number of the roses remain the same.

2. Let's analyze each bottom pair:
   - (A) shows a red hat turning into a blue hat. The transformation involved is a change in color only.
   - (B) shows a red hat turning into another red hat of the same color. There is no change in this transformation.
   - (C) shows a red hat turning into a green hat. The transformation involves a change in color only.

3. The transformation that matches the top pair's change is the one that involves only a color change. Both (A) and (C) represent color changes, but the specific color transformation we need to match is red to green.

4. (A) involves a change from red to blue, which does not match the red to green color change of the top pair.

5. (C) perfectly matches the top pair, as it shows a red object changing into a green object, with no other changes.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) because it corresponds to the same type of transformation observed in the top pair (a change in color from",1,ColourGreen

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

Top Transformation:
- The transformation involves a change in color. The rose changes from red to green.

Bottom Transformations:
(A) - The two caps change colors from red to purple and also appear to change their orientation slightly, as the direction of the visor changes from left-pointing to right-pointing.
(B) - There is no change except for the direction of the visor, which flips from the first to the second cap.
(C) - The cap changes from red to green, similar to the color change observed in the top transformation with the rose. There is no change in size, orientation, or number.

Since we are looking for a transformation that involves a change in color, and only option (C) matches the color change without changing the orientation or any other attribute, it is the correct choice.",1,ColourGreen

Let's examine the transformation on the top of the puzzle first:
- The left object is a red piece of what appears to be playdough or clay.
- The right object is a green piece of the same material.

The transformation involves a change in color from red to green.

Now let's analyze the three transformations on the bottom, marked A, B, and C, to identify which matches the transformation on the top:

- (A) shows an orange car transforming into a blue car. This represents a change in color, but the colors involved (orange to blue) do not match the top transformation (red to green).
- (B) shows an orange car first, followed by another orange car, and then a third car that is red. This shows no transformation but presents an ordering of cars in different colors. There is no matching transformation to the top sequence.
- (C) shows an orange car that transforms into a green car. This is a change in color similar to the top sequence, which converts red to green.

Considering the change in color is the only factor for the transformation, and since (C) matches the top sequence in terms of change from one color to another (specifically orange to green, paralleling red to green), (C) is the correct analogical match to the transformation seen at the top of the puzzle.",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The top transformation shows a playdough or clay piece changing color from red to green but maintaining its shape and size.

- Transformation (A): The car changes color from red to blue but maintains its shape and orientation. It does not match the top transformation because the color change is different (red to blue instead of red to green), and there is no change in orientation or other properties in the top transformation.

- Transformation (B): The car changes color from red to green and maintains its shape and orientation. This matches the top transformation where the only change is the color from red to green.

- Transformation (C): The car remains the same in color (orange/red), shape, and size, showing no transformation. This does not match the top transformation.

To determine the correct transformation that matches the one on the top of the puzzle, let's analyze the transformations step-by-step:

The top transformation shows a red, amorphous object changing color to green from left to right.

Looking at the transformations marked (A), (B) and (C) on the bottom, we have to find a transformation that only involves a change in the color of an object.

(A) This transformation shows an orange car that remains orange with no changes. The transformation does not involve a change in color or any other property; therefore, (A) is not the correct match.

(B) This transformation shows an orange car changing into a blue car, which involves a change of color. However, the orientation of the car also changes as it flips upside-down. Since the transformation on top does not involve a change in orientation, (B) is also not the correct match.

(C) This transformation shows an orange car changing into a green car, which matches the type of change that the top transformation is showing: a change in color only. The orientation, size, and number of the object remain constant.

Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because it matches the top transformation of an object changing its color.",1,ColourGreen

2. Looking at the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:
   - (A) shows a color change from purple to green, similar to the top transformation, but it also includes a change in the number of petals on the flower, which is an additional change not seen in the reference transformation.
   - (B) shows no change between the left and right images, so it doesn't match the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a color change from purple to a shade of red/orange, with no other property changing.

Top Transformation
The object on top is a stag that goes through a color change from purple to green. The orientation and size remain the same; only the color changes.

Bottom Transformations
(A) This transformation involves a change in color from purple to green, which at first glance appears similar to the top transformation, but there is also a change in orientation. The leaves which were pointing down in the first image are pointing upward in the second. This is an additional change not present in the top transformation.
(B) This transformation involves just a change in color from purple to orange, without any changes in size, orientation, or number, which is consistent with the top transformation's single-variable change.
(C) This transformation shows no changes at all between the two stages of the plant, so it does not match the top transformation.

- Option (B) shows a flower changing color from blue to red and then to green, representing a two-step color change that matches the change from purple to green in the top transformation (if we consider them as different color steps).
- Option (C) shows a flower that stays the same color throughout both transformations, which does not match the color change in the top transformation.

   - For option (C), the color changes from red to blue. While this is a color change, it isn't the same as the top transformation from red to green.

Now let's examine the options:

- Option (A): Shows a red ice cream object changing into a green ice cream object. This is a color change, which is similar to the transformation on the top. However, this is not just a simple color change; it also appears that the pattern of toppings or texture on the ice cream changes between the red and green versions.

- Option (C): Shows a red ice cream object changing into a blue ice cream object. This is a color change, but the color change does not match the top transformation from red to green. Also, similar to (A), the pattern of toppings or texture on the ice cream changes between the red and blue versions.

Option (B) is the only transformation that matches the lion's transformation on top in that there is no change other than the positional context (moving from the left to the right side in the sequence).

The correct match would be the one where only one attribute changes in the same manner as the bunny on top – a change in color.

29,1,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The answer to the visual puzzle is (C).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, we see that the change involves a color shift from blue to green, while the object itself—a bunny on a base—remains the same in terms of shape and orientation.

2. Now let's examine the bottom transformations:

   - (A) shows two images of a bag with a consistent blue color, so there's no color change here.
   - (B) shows a color transition from blue to green, as with the top transformation, but it also includes a change in the imagery/pattern on the bag's surface, which introduces an additional change not present in the top transformation.
   - (C) shows a color change from blue to red, without any alteration to the bag's pattern. This mirrors the top transformation in that only the color changes, and the object itself (its design and form) remains the same.

3. Therefore, since we are looking for a transformation similar to the top one, which only involves a color change, and (C) is the only one of the three options that includes solely a color change, the correct answer is (C).",0,ColourRed

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation concerning the rabbit object, we notice that the only change that occurs is the color change from blue to green; the size, orientation, and number of rabbits remain constant.

2. Now we analyze the transformations of the bottom objects:

   - Transformation (A) shows a change in orientation as the backpack is flipped; therefore, this is not a match since there's no change in orientation in the top transformation.
   
   - Transformation (B) shows a color change from blue to red with no alterations in size, orientation, or number of backpacks. This matches the transformation pattern of the top object, which also only changes color.
   
   - Transformation (C) shows a color change from blue to green, which does match the top transformation in terms of color change. However, there is additionally a change in pattern on the backpacks (the sports equipment images are replaced by a different set), making it a mismatch since the top object does not have a change in patterns, just color.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top transformation of the puzzle is the color change, which is seen in transformation (B).",0,ColourRed

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation of the object at the top from left to right and then compare it with the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C).

Top Transformation:
- The object (a rooster) changes color from a purple to a green shade.
- There do not appear to be any changes in size, orientation, or number of the object; only the color changes.

Now we'll compare this transformation to each of the options below:

Option (A):
- The object (a curved shape or ""pacman"" like figure) remains the same color in both frames. There is no change in color, size, orientation, or number.
- This does not match the transformation on the top because it should involve a change in color.

Option (B):
- The object changes color from blue to green.
- The size, orientation, and number remain constant.
- This transformation matches the top transformation because the only change that occurs is a change in color.

Option (C):
- The object changes color from blue to orange.
- The size, orientation, and number remain constant.
- Although this transformation involves a change in color, it is not the same as the top transformation because the color in the top transformation changes to green, not orange.

Based on the analysis of each option, the only transformation that matches the top transformation, which is a simple color change, without altering size, orientation, or number, is option (B).",1,ColourGreen

Let's analyze the transformation of the object on top:

1. The left image shows a rooster with purple feathers.
2. The right image shows a rooster with green feathers.

The transformation involves a change in color while maintaining the same size and orientation.

Now let's analyze the transformations for objects (A), (B), and (C) to find the one that matches the transformation pattern seen on top:

(A) Purple object retains its color and orientation with no changes.
(B) Purple object changes color to orange while maintaining the same size and orientation.
(C) Purple object changes color to green but also changes orientation which is different from the pattern on top.

Option (B) is the only object transformation where only the color changes while size and orientation remain constant, therefore it matches the transformation seen with the roosters on top.",0,ColourRed
30,2,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Transformation in the top sequence: The rooster changes color from blue to green. There are no other changes in size, orientation, or number.

2. Let's consider the transformations in each of the bottom sequences:
   - (A) shows a color change from purple to orange; however, there is also a change in orientation (the object is flipped horizontally), which is not present in the top sequence.
   - (B) shows no change in color but only a change in orientation (the object is flipped vertically), which doesn’t match the top sequence transformation.
   - (C) shows a color change from purple to green with no other changes, which matches the top sequence transformation.

3. (C) presents the only transformation that involves a mere change in color without any other additional changes, which is the same type of transformation observed in the top sequence with the rooster.

Hence, based on the matching change in color with no other alterations, the correct answer is (C).",1,ColourGreen
31,0,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Examination of the top transformation of the toy train reveals two main changes: a color change (from red and purple shades to green shades) and an orientation change (the tail of the rope winding from right to left instead of the other way round). 

2. Now let's examine the changes in the objects in the three bottom transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C):

   - In (A), the object (a number 2 shaped cookie) only changes in orientation (clockwise rotation).
   - In (B), the object changes both in color (from orange with red spots to green with dark green spots) and in orientation (again, a clockwise rotation).
   - In (C), there is only a color change (from orange with red spots to purple with blue spots); the orientation stays the same.

3. Since the top transformation involves both a change in color and orientation, and (B) is the only option among (A), (B), and (C) where both changes occur, it is the correct answer.",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Let's examine the transformation on top of the puzzle. We have a train with a red locomotive and orange wagon that transforms into a green locomotive and green wagon. The only changes in this transformation are the color changes from red to green and from orange to green.

2. Now, let's inspect the bottom transformations:

   a. Transformation (A) shows a color change from orange with red spots to purple with blue spots from the first to the second image. This is not a match, as the top transformation features a color change to the same color (green) for both elements, not two distinct colors.

   b. Transformation (B) shows a color change from orange with red spots to green with green spots from the first to the second image. This matches the transformation on top, where both elements change to the same color (green).

   c. Transformation (C) shows no color change; it retains the orange color with red spots in both images, so this is not a match.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the top one is (B).",1,ColourGreen
31,2,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we observe that the primary change is in color. The toy train changes color from a combination of red and orange to green.

2. Now let's analyze the bottom transformations:
   - In (A), the transformation involves a change in color from red to green and the pattern on the object changes as well.
   - In (B), the cookie changes its position (orientation) while maintaining the same color.
   - In (C), there is a change from red to purple, which is like a change in color observed in the top transformation.

3. (C) is the one that matches the top transformation since it purely involves a change in color without other kinds of transformation such as orientation, pattern change, or position.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top of the puzzle, you see an object that changes color from left to right: it starts as red on the left and becomes green on the right.

2. Now looking at the bottom of the puzzle:
   - Choice (A) shows an object that changes in color from orange to purple, and then changes again in the second frame to orange. This is not a single color change but rather a pattern of change, reversal, and change again.
   - Choice (B) shows a single object that changes from orange to green, which mirrors the color change from red to green in the top puzzle.
   - Choice (C) shows an object that remains the same color (orange) but changes in size from smaller to larger.

32,1,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top of the visual puzzle shows a red object changing into a green object from left to right. We can infer that the only transformation occurring is a change in color.

2. Looking at the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom:
   - (A) Displays a horse that changes from red to green in color. This matches the color transformation seen at the top.
   - (B) Shows a horse changing from red to purple, which is not the same transformation as the top, where the object changes from red to green.
   - (C) Displays a horse that remains the same color, red, in both panels, indicating no transformation in color.

3. Since the transformation in (A) is the only option that involves a change in color, from red to green, which is the same transformation shown at the top of the puzzle, (A) is the correct answer.

1. On the top of the puzzle, we see an object that undergoes a color change from red on the left to green on the right.

2. Looking at the three transformations on the bottom, marked (A), (B), and (C), we need to determine which one undergoes the same kind of transformation as the object on the top.

3. Option (A) shows a horse that changes from red to green from left to right, which matches the color change of the object on the top.

4. Option (B) shows a horse that remains the same color (red) from left to right, so there is no change.

5. Option (C) shows a horse that changes from red to purple from left to right, which is a color change but not the same color change as the object on the top.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation at the top first and then apply the observed transformation rule to the options below to see which one matches.

1. Looking at the top transformation, we observe that the sofa changes color from red to green. The orientation, size, and number of sofas remain unchanged, and therefore the transformation rule is a change in color only.

2. Now let's examine the options (A), (B), and (C) for the same transformation rule of a change in color:
   - Option (A) shows two guitars of the same red color, with no change occurring from left to right. So, option (A) does not match the rule of a color change.
   - Option (B) shows a red guitar on the left that changes to green on the right, matching the transformation rule observed in the example at the top (a color change from red to green).
   - Option (C) shows a red guitar on the left that changes to blue on the right, which is a color change but not the same as the top transformation from red to green.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only option that follows the same exact transformation rule as the example given at the top, which is a color change from red to green while keeping the size, orientation, and number the same.",1,ColourGreen

Let's break down the transformation in the top row first. We can see that the transformation from left to right involves changing the color of the object (a sofa) from red to green without changing its size, orientation, or number of objects.

Now let's analyze the transformations in the bottom row, marked by (A), (B), and (C):

- In (A), the left-to-right transformation changes the color of the object (a guitar) from red to green without changing its size, orientation, or the number of objects. This matches the transformation observed in the top row.
- In (B), the transformation involves a change in the orientation of the guitar (flipped horizontally) and its color from red to purple; this is not the same as the top row.
- In (C), the transformation only involves a duplication of the object without a change in color, size, or orientation, which is also not the same as the top row.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it's the only option where the same type of transformation (a change in color) occurs as the one on the top of the puzzle.",1,ColourGreen

2. Now let's consider the transformations on the bottom:
   - (A) involves a change both in color and orientation of the guitar.
   - (B) involves only a change in color, from red to green, similar to the sofa transformation.
   - (C) involves a change in color, from red to blue, and also the guitar's size increases.

3. Since we are looking for a transformation that mirrors the one at the top, we can rule out (A) and (C) because (A) changes orientation and color and (C) changes color and size.

4. The correct answer is (B) because, just like the sofa on the top, the guitar changes only its color from red to green without a change in size, orientation, or number.",0,No change

Let's analyze the visual puzzle:

The top of the puzzle features a popsicle undergoing a transformation from left to right. The changes between the two popsicles are:
1. The orientation of the popsicle remains the same.
2. The color changes from a combination of red on top and orange at the bottom to green on top and brown at the bottom.
3. No changes in the size or number of popsicles are observed.

Now, we'll compare this transformation to each of the three options below (A), (B), or (C):

(A) The fox changes color from red to green from left to right while maintaining the same orientation, size, and number.
(B) The fox remains the same color in both panels, with no other changes, indicating no transformation.
(C) The fox's color changes from red to purple, and the orientation also changes, with the fox facing away in the second image.

Therefore, the transformation sequence in (A) matches the transformation at the top, because the only change that occurs is in color, while the orientation, size, and number remain constant. Options (B) and (C) either show no change or multiple changes, which do not align with the single change observed in the top transformation.",1,ColourGreen

Top Transformation Analysis:
- The popsicle changes color from red-orange to green.
- The orientation does not change.
- The size does not change.
- The number of popsicles does not change; there remains only one.

Bottom Transformation Analysis:

(A) The color of the fox stays the same, ruling out this transformation, as it does not match the color change in the top transformation.
(B) The fox changes color from red to blue, as well as a slight orientation change (the blue fox is facing more to the front). This option is ruled out due to the additional orientation change, which does not happen in the top transformation.
(C) The fox changes color from red to green, with no other changes in orientation, size, or number. This matches the top transformation, where only the color changes.

Thus, the bottom transformation that matches the top one is (C).",1,ColourGreen

1. In the top transformation, the popsicle changes color from a combination of red and orange to a combination of green and brown. Additionally, there is a 180-degree rotation around the vertical axis.

2. Option (A) depicts a fox changing color from orange to green, and mirroring across a vertical axis, but not rotating.

3. Option (B) depicts a fox that maintains the same coloration (red/orange) but undergoes a 180-degree rotation around the vertical axis, similar to the transformation of the popsicle at the top.

4. Option (C) shows a color change from orange to purple as well as a 180-degree rotation, hence altering more than one attribute compared to the top transformation.

Therefore, since option (B) is the only one that undergoes the same type of transformation as the popsicle at the top of the puzzle (a 180-degree rotation around the vertical axis without a color change), the correct answer is (B).",0,No change

To solve the puzzle, let's examine the left-to-right transformation of the object on top and compare it with the transformations of the objects marked (A), (B), and (C).

Top transformation:
- The object (a toy shark) changes color from red to green.
- There is no change in size, orientation, or number of the object.

Bottom transformations:
- (A) features a red trash bin changing to a blue trash bin. This involves a change in color only.
- (B) shows a red trash bin that does not change in color, size, orientation, or count, thus no transformation occurs.
- (C) presents a red trash bin that changes in color to a green one with no other changes.

Based on this analysis, option (A) matches the top transformation because it represents a change in the color of the object without altering its size, orientation, or number. The top transformation involves changing the color from red to green, while (A) involves changing the color from red to blue, which is the only discrepancy. Since the requirement is to match the type of transformation rather than the specific colors, (A) is considered a match. Options (B) and (C) do not match because (B) shows no change, and (C) represents a color change similar to the top transformation, but only (A) is consistent with the type of transformation seen on top, which is a change in color while maintaining the same size",0,ColourBlue

3. Transformation (A) shows the object changing from red to blue. This does not match the red to green pattern seen on top, so we can eliminate option (A).
4. Transformation (B) shows the object remaining the same color (red) without any change to green, so we can eliminate option (B).

   - Option (A) shows a change in color from red to green, like the transformation on top, but it also shows a change in orientation, which is not present in the top transformation.
   
   - Option (B) shows no change – the trash bins are identical in both color and orientation, so there's no match with the top transformation.
   
   - Option (C) exhibits a change in color from red to blue without any change in size, number, or orientation. This matches the type of transformation on the top where only the color changed.

3. Option (B) shows no change at all; the object remains the same in both color and orientation.

4. Option (C) shows a color change from blue to red, while the shape and orientation of the object remain the same.

   - For (B), the object remains the same color (purple) and no other changes are observed.

   - (C) also shows the beetle changing color but it goes from purple to red, which is not the same as the blue to green transformation seen in the top example.

   (A) The object (a fly) changes in color from purple to red. This is a color change like in the top transformation, but we need to check if other attributes remain constant.
   
   (B) The object changes from purple to green in color, which is the same as the top transformation. However, the green object is also flipped horizontally, which is an additional change not seen in the top transformation. Therefore, (B) is not the correct analogy.
   
   (C) The object changes in color from purple to purple (no change in color). All other attributes—size, orientation, and number—remain the same. This does not match the top transformation since there should be a color change.

   - (C) shows a change from blue to green, but the object also changes from a flower to a leaf, which introduces an additional transformation not present in the example above.

3. Since the transformation we are focusing on is the change in color, and despite the different color change in the example, (B) is the only option that reflects solely a change in color, matching the type of transformation shown on the top with the butterfly.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation, we see a butterfly that changes color from blue to green.

2. The object itself, namely the butterfly, does not change in size, orientation, or number, but only in color.

3. Examining the three bottom transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C), we must find the one that shows a change in color but not in size, orientation, or number.

4. Option (A) shows a change in color from blue to red and a change in the orientation of the flowers— this does not match the transformation pattern of the butterfly.

5. Option (C) also shows a change in color from blue to green, but there's a problem; the number of flowers changes as well, there are fewer green flowers than blue flowers. Again, this does not match the transformation pattern of the butterfly since the butterfly does not change in number.

6. Option (B) shows a change of color from blue to violet, with no change in size, orientation, or number. This matches the transformation pattern of the butterfly, which only changed color.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

Examining the transformation of the object on the top:
- The left image shows a butterfly with predominantly blue wings.
- The right image shows the same butterfly after rotating 180 degrees and changing its wing color to green.

Now let's analyze the transformations of the object on the bottom for each letter:

(A) The transformation involves a change in color from blue to green, but there's no rotation of the object.
(B) The transformation involves both a change in color from blue to a red/orange hue and a rotation of the object, which appears to be 180 degrees, as in the case of the butterfly on the top.
(C) There is no change in color or rotation; it's just a duplicated image of the original object.

Since option (B) involves the same type of transformation observed in the top object (a 180-degree rotation and a change in color), (B) is the correct answer.",0,ColourRed

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation from left to right, the change is from a red object (hamburger bun) to a green object (lettuce) of the same size and orientation.

2. Now we will evaluate each of the bottom transformations:
   - In (A), the transformation is from an orange tram to a blue tram; this change is in color but represents two different colors, unlike the top transformation which is from red to green.
   - In (B), the transformation is from an orange tram to another orange tram with no change in color, size, orientation, or number, so this does not match the top transformation.
   - In (C), the transformation is from an orange tram to a green tram with no change in size or orientation, which matches the type of change observed in the top transformation (a change from one color to another).

Therefore, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation is (C), where there is a change in color with no changes in size, orientation, or number.",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The puzzle at the top shows a transformation in color from red to green while retaining the same shape and size.

2. Option (A) shows no change at all; the object remains identical from left to right.

3. Option (B) shows a change in color from orange to blue while retaining the same shape and size. This matches the type of transformation observed in the puzzle at the top (color change while keeping shape and size constant).

4. Option (C) shows a change in both color and shape, going from an orange tram to a green bus -- hence, introducing an additional transformation beyond just a color change.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on the top is (B) because it only involves a change in color while keeping the shape and size unchanged.",0,ColourBlue
40,2,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The transformation observed at the top of the puzzle is a color change from red to green while maintaining the same object size, orientation, and number.
- Now we compare this transformation to the ones marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle.

Option (A): The object maintains its color (orange) and only changes the orientation of the wheels. This is not the same transformation as the one on top.

Option (B): The object changes color from orange to blue while maintaining the same object size, orientation, and number. This directly mirrors the transformation observed at the top with the change from red to green.

Option (C): The object changes both color (from orange to green) and orientation (it rotates to stand on its rear end). This involves an additional transformation (orientation change) beyond the color change, which is different than the transformation on top.

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer, as it is the only transformation that only involves a change in color while all other aspects of the object remain the same.",0,ColourBlue

The transformation shown on top involves a change in color from red to green while keeping the object's size, orientation, and number constant.

Now let's analyze the transformations for each option:

- In option (A), there is a color change from orange to purple, which is a different color change compared to the one in the top transformation.
- In option (B), there is a color change from red to green, which matches exactly with the color change from red to green as shown in the top transformation.
- In option (C), while the object remains the same color (orange), it also stays the same in size, orientation, and number, which means there is no transformation at all.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct transformation as it is the only bottom transformation that matches the top transformation's change in color while keeping the other attributes constant.",1,ColourGreen

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation at the top shows a bottle that changes color from red to green from left to right.

2. Now let's look at the transformations at the bottom:

   - (A) shows the same object (a red truck) with no transformation, so this is not the correct answer.
   - (B) shows a color transformation from orange to purple of the same object, similar to the color change of the bottle at the top.
   - (C) shows a color change from orange to green, but it also involves changing the orientation of the object, which is unlike the transformation of the bottle at the top.

3. Based on the observed transformations, the sequence that matches the top transformation (a change in color only) is (B). The trucks change color from orange to purple without any other changes, just like the bottle changes color from red to green.",0,ColourBlue

To solve this visual puzzle, let’s examine the transformations that occur in both the transformation on the top and the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

Top Transformation:
1. Color: The left object is red, and the right object is green.
2. Size: No change in size between the left and right objects.
3. Orientation: No change in orientation between the left and right objects.
4. Number: Both the left and right images have a single object.

Thus, the transformation on the top involves only a change in color from red to green.

Bottom Transformations (A, B, C):
(A) Change in color from red to blue.
(B) No change.
(C) Change in color from red to green.

Therefore, transformation (C) on the bottom matches the top transformation because it is the only one that also involves a change in color from red to green without any changes in size, orientation, or number.",1,ColourGreen

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we see a change in color (from purple to green) and orientation (the object has been rotated).

2. Looking at the bottom transformations:
   - (A) shows a change from purple to green (color change) but no change in orientation.
   - (B) shows no change in color but a change in orientation (the object has been rotated).
   - (C) shows a change from blue to red (color change) and a change in orientation (the object has been rotated).

Since we are looking for a transformation that involves both a color change and an orientation change, the only option that fits this pattern is (C).",0,ColourRed
42,1,0,Green,0,Green,Red,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:

Top Transformation: The visual change here involves a color shift from blue to green while maintaining the number of objects and their orientation.

Option (A): This transformation demonstrates no change, as the object remains blue and retains its orientation from left to right.

Option (B): This transformation shows a color change from blue to red, maintaining the number of objects and their orientation. This most closely resembles the color transition observed in the top transformation, aside from the different color choice.

Option (C): This transformation displays a color shift from blue to green, which aligns with the color change in the top transformation. However, it also involves a rotation, which does not match the top transformation where the orientation remained constant.

Given the criteria, we can rule out options (A) and (C), as they either experience no change or an incorrect change in orientation. Option (B), despite the different color used, is the only option that reflects a consistent kind of change with the top transformation – a change of color while maintaining the orientation and number of objects.",0,ColourRed

Let's analyze the transformations step by step:

Top transformation:
1. We have a set of objects that change color from purple to green.
2. Simultaneously, the objects also change their orientation; they turn 90 degrees clockwise as they change color from purple to green.

Now, comparing this with the bottom transformations:

(A) There is a change in color from blue to red, but there is no change in orientation.
(B) There is a simultaneous change in color from blue to green and a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
(C) The only change is in color from blue to purple with no change in orientation or number.

The transformation in (B) matches the one at the top of the puzzle, as it involves both a change in color and a 90-degree clockwise turn.",1,ColourGreen

(A) A purple pig becomes green. This matches the color change on top, but there is no additional transformation, whereas on top, the object rotates.

(B) A purple pig becomes red. In addition to the change in color, the pig also flips upside down or rotates. This matches the top transformation where the object changes color and also seems to rotate.

(C) Two purple pigs. This does not involve any color change or rotation, only an increase in number.

Therefore, the transformation that matches the one on top of the puzzle is (B) because it involves a change in both color and orientation/position of the object.",0,ColourRed

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation on the top of the puzzle, we see a shell transitioning from purple to green.

2. The only transformation that must be analyzed is the change in color. Size, orientation, and number remain constant, as there is one shell in each image, and its size and orientation do not change.

3. Analyzing the options given at the bottom:

   (A) shows a change in color (from blue to red), but it involves two pigs, whereas the top pattern only involves one object changing color.
   
   (B) shows a single pig changing color from blue to purple, which is consistent with the type of transformation seen in the top pattern, where one object changes color.
   
   (C) also shows a single pig changing color, but the color change is from blue to green, which is not the same color change as in the top pattern (purple to green).

1. Analyzing the transformation at the top: We see that the object, which appears to be a shell, changes its color from purple to green from left to right.

2. Comparing to option (A): Here the transformation involves a change in color from blue to red but is inconsistent with the top transformation, as there is no orientation or shape change in the top transformation.

3. Comparing to option (B): This shows a color change from blue to green, which is consistent with the top transformation's change in color (from purple to green). There is no change in orientation or shape, which is also consistent with the top transformation.

4. Comparing to option (C): This transformation only involves a change in orientation from left to right, with no change in color. This does not match the top transformation, which involves a color change without an orientation change.

- In option (B), the color of the decorations and icing on the cupcake remains the same, while the color of the cupcake base changes from blue to purple. This is the closest match.
- In option (C), the colors of the icing and base both change from blue and purple to green. This is not the exact transformation; it involves changing two colors rather than just one.

1. Observe the transformation of the object at the top (the dinosaurs): The object undergoes a color change from blue to green while retaining its shape and size.

2. Inspect each of the transformations for objects (A), (B), and (C) (the cupcakes) at the bottom:

   - Transformation (A) shows a color change from all elements being initially blue to the base and toppings changing to red, but the item on top remains blue. Therefore, it doesn't match the top transformation where all parts of the object change color uniformly.

   - Transformation (B) shows a color change from all elements being initially blue to all elements changing to purple. This uniformly affects the entire cupcake, much like the top transformation affects the entire dinosaur.

   - Transformation (C) shows a color change from all elements being blue to different parts changing to different colors (topping changes to green, base changes to red). This does not match the top transformation, which does not feature a multicolor change.

Out of the three options, transformation (A) is the most similar to the top transformation because it involves only a change in color.

   - Option (C) shows a change from red to blue, not red to green, and therefore does not match the top transformation.

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation on the top of the puzzle and then apply the same logic to the options below.

On the top, we see a red mug with a pattern transforming into a green mug with the same pattern. The transformation involves a change in color from red to green while the design on the mug remains constant.

Now we'll apply the same principle to the options given:

- (A) shows a red object in both frames, which means there's no change in color or pattern, contrasting the transformation at the top.
- (B) shows a red object with yellow specks transforming into a green object with yellow specks. This matches the transformation at the top, where the color changes from red to green while the pattern (yellow specks in this case) remains consistent.
- (C) shows a red object with yellow specks changing into a blue object with purple specks. This involves a change in both the color of the object and the specks, which is different from the top transformation.

(C) Shows a red cup transforming into a blue cup. While this is also a color change, it is a change to a different color than the one in the top transformation.

On the top of the puzzle, we see a transformation of a couch. The left image shows a red couch, and to the right, there's a green couch. The only change here is the color of the couch; it goes from red to green.

Now let's look at the transformations of the fish on the bottom of the puzzle:

(A) shows a fish that changes color from brown to blue.
(B) shows a fish that doesn't change color but changes orientation by flipping upside down.
(C) shows a fish that changes color from brown to green.

Since the transformation on the top involves a change in color only, we need to find the transformation option that also involves only a change in color. The only option that satisfies this condition is (C), where the fish changes color from brown to green without any other alterations.",1,ColourGreen
49,2,0,Green,0,Green,Blue,0,"The correct answer is (B).

Let's go through the step-by-step reasoning:

- The top transformation shows a sofa that changes color from red to green.
- Transformation (A) shows a fish that remains the same color (does not change).
- Transformation (B) shows a fish that changes color from orange/brown to green (changes color).
- Transformation (C) shows a fish that changes color from orange/brown to blue (changes color).

We are looking for the transformation that involves a color change without any other changes. While both options (B) and (C) involve color changes, we need to determine which color change is analogously similar to the one with the sofa.

- The sofa changes from one solid color to another solid color.
- In transformation (B), the fish color change closely matches the type of transformation seen with the sofa (one solid color to another).
- In transformation (C), although there is a color change, the resulting blue color is not analogous to the green sofa in the sense of real-world object colors – sofas are commonly found in colors like red and green, while blue is a less common and therefore less directly analogous color for fish in this context.

Therefore, by looking at the color transformation in a real-world context, we can conclude that transformation (B) is the one that most closely fits the transformation seen on the top of the puzzle, which is a simple color change from one solid and common color to another without any other alterations.",1,ColourGreen
