Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, the image on the left appears to rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise to become the image on the right. 

2. Looking at option (A), the object appears to have rotated by 180 degrees rather than 90 degrees. 

3. Option (B) shows the object rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which matches the transformation direction and degree of the training transformation.

4. Option (C) does not show any rotation between the left and right pictures; the object remains in the same orientation.

Therefore, transformation (B) is the one that follows the identified transformation—a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.",1,90
17,1,0,90,0,90,"(C)

The correct transformation is (C). Here's the step-by-step reasoning for my choice:

1. The training transformation shows a 90-degree rotation from left to right. The green object with orange vegetation and grey rocks start with the orange vegetation on the left side and, after transformation, appear on the right side of the green object.

2. Looking at transformation (A), the drill is flipped horizontally, not rotated, so this transformation does not match the training transformation.

3. Examining transformation (B), we see that the drill remains essentially unchanged in its orientation from left to right. Therefore, there is no rotation, so this transformation does not match the training transformation.

4. Finally, looking at transformation (C), the drill in the left image has the handle pointing to the left, and in the right image, the handle points downward. This is consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which matches the training transformation's rotation.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is (C), as it follows the identified 90-degree rotation transformation.",0,180
17,2,0,90,0,90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the training transformation, the object on the left is rotated by 90 degrees to obtain the object on the right. This is a rotational transformation rather than any other type (such as reflection, enlargement, or translation).
2. Looking at the given options:
   - Transformation (A) shows the object being mirrored rather than rotated.
   - Transformation (B) shows the object has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which matches the training transformation.
   - Transformation (C) shows the object being rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which is not the same direction of rotation as the training example.
   
Therefore, the correct transformation that follows the identified training transformation is (B).",1,90
24,0,0,90,0,90,"The correct transformation is option (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:
We are looking for a 90-degree rotation of an object from left to right. A 90-degree rotation would mean that the side of the object that was initially facing downwards would become the side that faces the viewer after the rotation.

- For option (A), the lizard on the left is lying on its belly with its feet pointing towards the ground. After the transformation, the lizard is seen from the top, but this transformation cannot be a simple 90-degree rotation. It looks more like a flip along the vertical axis.

- In Option (B), the lizard again starts lying on its belly. After the transformation, the lizard appears on its side, which suggests a rotation of around 90 degrees, but the orientation of its legs and the angle of rotation do not match the original training transformation. The legs and head orientation suggest this could be a 90-degree rotation followed by a flip or a different type of rotation that also changes the spatial arrangement.

- For option (C), the lizard starts with its belly towards the viewer. After the transformation, the lizard is oriented so that its back is facing the viewer, which is consistent with a 90-degree rotation along the axis running from its head to its tail. This matches the understood transformation where the bottom of the first object becomes the side facing the viewer after rotation.

Therefore, the transformation following the same pattern as the training transformation is (C).",1,90
24,1,0,90,0,90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The training transformation involves rotating the object (a couch) by 90 degrees from a horizontal position to a vertical position.
- We need to look for a transformation among options (A), (B), and (C) that involves a similar 90-degree rotation without any other change such as flipping or additional rotation.

Observing each option:

- Option (A) shows a transformation where the lizard toy appears to be flipped rather than simply rotated; notice how the legs on one side are pointing upward in the first image, but in the second image, these legs are pointing downward, indicating a flip rather than a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (B) shows a lizard toy rotated by 90 degrees to the right, which is consistent with the given training transformation. The legs that are on the ground in the first image are on the right side in the second image, and the legs that are up on the left in the first image are down in the second image, which is consistent with a clockwise 90-degree rotation.
- Option (C) shows minimal change and the lizard toy is not rotated at all. It appears to be the same orientation in both the left and right images.

Thus, the only image pair that accurately represents the 90-degree rotation as described in the training transformation is (B).",0,180
24,2,0,90,0,90,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the training transformation, the sofa rotates 90 degrees clockwise to achieve the final position.
2. To find the correct transformation among options (A), (B), and (C), we need to look for a transformation that shows a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

- For option (A), the left image of the lizard is facing up and to the left, and the right image is facing directly to the left. This is not a 90-degree rotation; it looks more like the lizard has been flipped horizontally.
- For option (B), the left image of the lizard is facing up and to the left, and the right image is facing upward. This indicates a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which matches the transformation of the training example.
- For option (C), the left image of the lizard is facing up and to the left, and the right image is facing down and to the left. This is a 180-degree rotation, not a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the identified transformation is (B).",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The training transformation shows a coffee cup on the left that is rotated by 90 degrees to the right to become the coffee cup picture on the right. Specifically, the coffee cup is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, as the handle that was originally on the left side in the first picture moves to the bottom in the second picture.
- Now, let's look at the given transformations:

(A) The object (a character with a cat-like head) is shown from the front in both the left and the right pictures. There is no apparent rotation from left to right.

(B) The object experiences a change from the front view to a view from the top, where the head of the character has been rotated 90 degrees forward. This is a rotation on a different axis than the training transformation—specifically along the horizontal axis, not the vertical axis.

(C) The object experiences a change from a front view to a side view, which indicates a rotation. When comparing both images, we can infer that the character was rotated 90 degrees clockwise around a vertical axis that goes through the center of the object, similar to the training transformation of the coffee cup.

Thus, option (C) is the correct one that follows the identified training transformation, which is a 90-degree clockwise rotation around a vertical axis.",1,+90
9,1,0,90,0,90,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a coffee cup viewed from above rotating 90 degrees clockwise to a side perspective.

2. Transformation (A) shows a character moving from an upright position to lying down on its side; this is not simply a rotation, as the orientation with respect to the viewer changes drastically (the face also turns downwards which is not consistent with a single 90-degree rotation).

3. Transformation (B) also shows the character from an upright position flipping over its vertical axis to rest on its back, which is similar to (A), indicating a flip rather than a 90-degree rotation.

4. Transformation (C) shows the character with a similar left-to-right orientation in both images, suggesting that it is the same image viewed from the same angle. 

Therefore, option (C) is the correct transformation as it maintains the object's orientation to the viewer, much like the coffee cup which keeps its design facing up despite the rotation.",0,No change
9,2,0,90,0,90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning for choice:

1. The training transformation showed a cup of coffee rotating by 90 degrees clockwise. It moved from an upright position where the cup opening faced up, to a side position where the cup opening faced to the right.

2. Now examining the three options:
   - (A): The object, a cartoonish cat-like figure, is flipped vertically. The position of the collar and bell changes from the bottom in the first image to the top in the second image. This is not a 90-degree rotation.
   - (B): The cat-like figure rotates clockwise, similar to the training transformation. The bottom of the figure moves to the right-side position, maintaining the orientation of its facial features and collar relative to each other (just as the coffee cup's design maintained its orientation relative to the cup). This follows the 90-degree rotation rule.
   - (C): The figure remains unchanged in orientation. There is no rotation or transformation of the object.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the identified training transformation is (B).",1,+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an elephant being rotated 90 degrees to the right. 

2. We are looking for a transformation that exhibits the same kind of rotation.

3. Transformation (A) does not apply because the object on the right is the same as the object on the left, with no apparent rotation.

4. Transformation (B) shows the scooter with riders rotated 90 degrees to the right, which matches the training transformation.

5. Transformation (C) shows a rotation to the left, which is the opposite direction to the training transformation.

Thus, the only transformation that follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree rotation to the right is (B).",1,+90
19,1,0,90,0,90,"(B)

To solve this visual puzzle, we analyze each set of images (A), (B), and (C) based on the ""training transformation"" shown in the first pair of images featuring the elephant. In the training pair, the elephant on the left rotates 90 degrees clockwise to become the elephant on the right.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) The image on the right appears to be a mirror reflection across the vertical axis rather than a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Hence, this is not the correct transformation.

(B) The image on the right looks like it has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise in relation to the image on the left. This matches the training transformation of the elephant images. If you visualize the person and the scooter in the first image of (B) rotating 90 degrees to the right (clockwise), they would appear as in the second image of (B). Therefore, this transformation follows the identified training transformation.

(C) The image on the right is identical to the image on the left, showing no rotation or change in orientation. Thus, it does not follow the training transformation.

Based on the visual evidence, the correct answer is (B), as it is the only transformation that includes a 90-degree clockwise rotation consistent with the training transformation.",1,+90
19,2,0,90,0,90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an elephant rotating 90 degrees clockwise to become the image on the right. We're looking for a similar 90 degrees clockwise rotation in the three given transformations.

2. Transformation (A) appears to show the same image on both the left and right with no rotation.

3. Transformation (B) shows a change in orientation that corresponds to a rotation. If you visualize the image on the left rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the wheels would end up on the bottom, and the rider and the scooter would change orientation as shown in the image on the right. This matches the 90-degree clockwise rotation observed in the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C) shows a change that is not a 90-degree rotation, but rather a horizontal flip because the rider and scooter have been mirrored across a vertical axis.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B), as it follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree clockwise rotation.",0,180

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze each left-to-right transformation by comparing it to the described training transformation, where the left image rotates by 90 degrees to become the right image:

- In transformation (A), the teddy bear on the left appears to be lying on its back in the image on the right. This is not simply a 90-degree rotation; it is a flip onto the back.
- In transformation (B), the teddy bear on the left seems unchanged in the image on the right. There is no rotation or other transformation applied.
- In transformation (C), the teddy bear on the left gets rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to become the teddy bear on the right, which now appears to be lying on its side.

Since transformation (C) follows the 90-degree rotation rule described in the training transformation, the correct answer is (C).",1,+90
47,1,0,90,0,90,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We've been given a training transformation: an object on the left has been rotated by 90 degrees to become the object on the right. In the training images, we see a wall-mounted cabinet with shelves on the left, and after a 90-degree rotation, it becomes a flat, open cabinet on the right.

2. Looking at option (A), we see a plush toy dog facing forward in both images. There is no rotation; the toy seems identical in both pictures.

3. In option (B), the plush toy is also facing forward in the left image. In the right image, the toy appears to be viewed from the side, but it isn’t solely a rotation; there is a change in perspective as well, which is not consistent with a simple 90-degree rotation.

4. Option (C) shows the plush toy facing forward in the left image and then appears rotated by 90 degrees clockwise in the right image, with its bottom now facing the viewer, consistent with the training transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer following the identified transformation is (C).",0,180
47,2,0,+90,0,90,"(C)

Let's go through each option step-by-step based on the training example provided where a cabinet is rotated by 90 degrees.

- (A) The stuffed animal on the left is laying on its back, while the one on the right is rotated in a way that places it on its side with its head facing towards us and its legs up in the air. This rotation is significantly more than 90 degrees.

- (B) The stuffed animal on the left is in the same position as the one on the right. There is no rotation here; the image on the right is a similar view from a different angle or is mirrored. 

- (C) The stuffed animal on the left is upright, and the one on the right is rotated 90 degrees to the left (its right side is now on the bottom). This maintains the same top-down orientation relative to the initial position, just as the cabinet's door rotates to face upwards on the training example.

Therefore, (C) is the correct transformation that follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree rotation, mimicking the initial rotation example.",1,+90
