Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a shark rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This sets the pattern to look for in the other images.
2. Let's examine each option:
   - In option (A), the lunch bag on the right appears to be flipped vertically in comparison to the one on the left. This is not just a 90-degree rotation.
   - In option (B), the lunch bag on the right appears to be a horizontal flip of the one on the left, which again is not the same as a 90-degree rotation.
   - In option (C), the lunch bag on the right is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the lunch bag on the left. The orientation of the sports items and brand logo confirms this transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) because it is the only option that follows the 90-degree rotation pattern established by the training transformation.",0,No change
35,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We are looking for a 90-degree rotation left-to-right transformation based on the training transformation shown with the shark images.

2. In option (A), the pattern on the bag remains the same and there is no evident rotation of the object from left to right. Therefore, this is not a correct transformation according to the training example.

3. Option (B) shows a flip of the bag where the left to the right side is the same, maintaining orientation, which means that it does not match the 90-degree rotation criteria either.

4. Option (C) shows a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the bag from left to right. We can tell because the logos and patterns on the bag have been rotated in that direction when comparing the position of the designs such as the basketball, football, and other items.

Thus, option (C) is the only transformation that follows the same 90-degree rotational change as the training transformation with the shark images.",0,180
35,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows that an object rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The shark's nose points up after the rotation, and we can distinctly notice the orientation change.

2. Analyzing (A), the bag on the right does not appear to have rotated; it's in the same orientation as the bag on the left, so transformation (A) is not correct.

3. In (B), the bag rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise. We can determine this by observing the positioning of the sports icons, especially the football and basketball. Their positions change relative to the borders of the bag in a way consistent with such a rotation. This matches the training transformation.

4. For (C), the bag appears to be flipped horizontally rather than rotated. This is evident by the upside-down text and images on the right compared to the left. Therefore, transformation (C) is not correct.

As a result, transformation (B) is the one that follows the identified training transformation.",0,180
32,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. The training transformation shows a rooster that is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image. The rooster's head points upward in the left image and points to the right in the right image.

2. Option (A) shows a cat that is rotated, but the direction of the rotation appears to be counter-clockwise when looking from the top-down perspective, which is the opposite of the training transformation.

3. Option (B) shows a cat with no apparent rotation, as the position and orientation of the cat remain the same in both the left and right images.

4. Option (C) shows a cat that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image, when observing from a top-down view. The head points upward in the left image and to the right in the right image, which matches the training transformation.

Therefore, option (C) correctly follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree clockwise rotation from our point of view.",1,-90
32,1,0,-90,0,-90,"(C)

Let's examine the transformations step by step:

1. In the training transformation, we observe that the rooster rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise to transform from the left picture to the right picture.

2. Now, let's look at each of the three provided transformations:
   - (A) shows a cat that appears to be flipped onto its back, rather than rotated.
   - (B) displays a similar flip to that seen in (A); it's not a rotation.
   - (C) shows a cat that has been rotated; the orientation of its head in relation to its body is the same, but its entire body has been rotated to the viewer's right, fitting the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation as per the training transformation.

Therefore, the correct option that follows the identified training transformation is (C).",0,No change
32,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation describes a rotation of an object 90 degrees to the right from the left image to the right image, as evidenced by the position of the rooster which changes its orientation while remaining the same in other aspects.

2. Transformation (A) shows the cat lying down on its side to the right, which is not a simple 90-degree rotation from the standing position.

3. Transformation (B) shows the cat rotated 90 degrees to the right relative to the standing position, which matches the training transformation of the rooster.

4. Transformation (C) demonstrates no change between the left and right images, meaning there is no rotation or transformation at all.

Therefore, (B) is the only option that follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree rotation to the right.",0,180
1,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observing the training transformation, we see that the left image of the fan is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the image on the right.

2. We have to identify which transformation shows the same 90-degree clockwise rotation.

3. Option (A) displays the carton of fries tilted to the right; it does not match the 90-degree clockwise rotation since we can't discern a clear rotation axis and the amount of visible fries changes substantially.

4. Option (B) displays the fries' carton turned upside down; this is not a 90-degree rotation but rather closer to a 180-degree flip across an axis lying in the plane of the screen.

5. Option (C) displays the carton of fries rotated slightly less than 90 degrees clockwise around an axis perpendicular to the screen. Although it doesn't show a perfect 90-degree rotation, it's the closest analogy to the fan's rotation depicted in the training transformation.

6. Considering all the available options, (C) is the transformation that best follows the rule identified by the training transformation, even if not perfectly aligning with the 90-degree requirement. Options (A) and (B) do not convey the specific type of rotation demonstrated in the training example.",0,No change
1,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. First, we analyze the training transformation given in the first image. It demonstrates a rotation of an object by 90 degrees clockwise when looking at the object from the front.

2. Option (A) shows the same side of the fries box before and after the transformation, but if the box were rotated 90 degrees clockwise in a similar fashion to the training transformation, we would see a different side of the box. Therefore, (A) does not follow the training transformation.

3. Option (B) shows the fries box before the transformation with one side facing the viewer. After the transformation, we see a different side of the box facing us, which indicates that the box has been rotated properly (assuming it rotated on a vertical axis akin to the one in the training image). The rotation is consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation when looking from the front, which matches the training transformation.

4. Option (C) is similar to (A) in that the same side of the fries box is visible before and after the transformation, so there's no indication of a 90-degree rotation that would present a different side of the box to the viewer.

Therefore, the left-to-right object transformation that follows the identified transformation is (B).",0,180
1,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object that has been rotated by 90 degrees. The object on the left is initially upright and the object on the right is on its side, having been turned clockwise.

2. Examining option (A), we see that the object on the left and the object on the right appear identical with no signs of rotation.

3. Looking at option (B), the French fries container on the left is upright, and in the right image, it has been rotated to lie on its side. The transformation exhibits a 90-degree clockwise rotation, corresponding to the training transformation.

4. Reviewing option (C), it appears that the French fries container has not just been rotated but also viewed from a different angle, or perhaps the container has been tipped over without rotation. The fries do not maintain the same orientation in space relative to the box compared to the training transformation.

Therefore, option (B) follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree rotation.",1,-90
4,0,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning for choice (C):
1. The training transformation shows an object that is rotated 90 degrees clockwise when observing from the left-to-right perspective.
2. Let's examine each of the transformations (A), (B), and (C) in that context.

(A) The grapes on the left have leaves that are pointing upwards, and the grapes on the right also have leaves that are pointing upwards. This indicates that there hasn't been a 90-degree rotation; the orientation of the grapes has remained the same.

(B) The grapes on the left have leaves that are pointing upwards, and the grapes on the right also have leaves that are pointing upwards. Again, this implies there is no 90-degree rotation.

(C) The grapes on the left have leaves pointing upwards, and the grapes on the right have leaves pointing to the right. This suggests a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the object from the left image to the right image, which matches the training transformation.

Therefore, transformation (C) follows the identified transformation of a 90-degree clockwise rotation.",0,180
4,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct answer is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a rotation by 90 degrees. We need to check each pair of images (A, B, C) to determine if there's a similar rotation from left to right.

2. In transformation (A), the bunch of grapes appears to have rotated, but the orientation of the leaves and the stem seems inconsistent with a 90-degree rotation.

3. In transformation (B), the orientation change of the leaves and stem on the grapes more closely matches a 90-degree rotation, similar to the one in the training transformation.

4. In transformation (C), the grapes and the leaves appear unchanged, which indicates there is no rotation occurring between the left and right images.

So option (B) is the correct answer as it demonstrates a rotation by 90 degrees similar to the training transformation.",1,-90
4,2,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation letter is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object rotating 90 degrees to the right from the left image to the right image. This is evident from the position of the tower and the circular structure which becomes vertical in the right image.

2. Looking at transformation (A), the grape bunch appears to have rotated, but the leaves on the top in the left image moved to the left side in the right image. This is not a simple 90-degree rotation to the right.

3. In transformation (B), the grape bunch in the left and right images looks identical with no rotation at all.

4. Transformation (C) shows the grape bunch in the right image rotated such that the green grape stem that is facing up in the left image is now pointing to the right in the right image. This indicates a 90-degree rotation to the right, which matches the training transformation.

Hence, based on the criteria given, option (C) is the one that follows the identified 90-degree rotation transformation.",1,-90
25,0,0,-90,0,-90,"(B)

In the training transformation, the object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. We need to apply this rule to the provided transformations to see which one matches.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Transformation (A) does not match because the object (a cap with a logo) appears to be the same in both the left and the right images without any rotation.
- Transformation (B) does match because the object (the cap) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image. The cap's brim points to the left in the first image and points downwards in the second, indicating a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- Transformation (C) does not match because although the cap is rotated, it is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is opposite to the direction of rotation we are looking for.

Thus, the correct transformation that follows the identified transformation is (B).",1,-90
25,1,0,-90,0,-90,"The correct transformation is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object rotating 90 degrees to the right (clockwise) when viewed from above. This is evident because the wheels, which are initially at the bottom when the object is viewed from the left, end up on the right side of the object when viewed from the right.

2. Transformation (A) shows a baseball cap which has undergone a similar 90-degree rotation to the right (clockwise) when viewed from above. Initially, the visor is pointing to the left, and then it is pointing downward after the transformation.

3. Transformation (B) does not show any rotation, as the baseball cap remains unaltered in its orientation from left to right.

4. Transformation (C) shows the baseball cap rotated, but it is a 90-degree rotation to the left (counterclockwise) from the perspective of the viewer, rather than to the right.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the identified training transformation is (A).",1,-90
25,2,0,-90,0,-90,"(C)

To determine which transformation follows the identified training transformation from the given options (A), (B), and (C), we need to carefully compare the transformation of the object in the training set with the transformations in each of the provided options.

In the training transformation, the object (which looks like a stroller) is rotated by 90 degrees to the right. When this rotation happens, the object's orientation changes in such a way that the feature that was at the top in the original position moves to the right in the transformed position.

Applying this observation to the provided options:

- (A) shows a baseball cap that has been slightly rotated or flipped, but the logo on the cap remains on the top side in both pictures, which does not match with a 90-degree rotation to the right.
  
- (B) exhibits a cap where the logo on the cap has moved from the top right to the bottom right, suggesting a flip along an axis rather than a rotation.

- (C) displays a cap where the logo moves from the top left position to the top right position. This indicates a rotation of the cap by 90 degrees to the right, just like the training transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C), as it is the only transformation displaying a similar 90-degree rightward rotation observed in the training transformation.",1,-90
