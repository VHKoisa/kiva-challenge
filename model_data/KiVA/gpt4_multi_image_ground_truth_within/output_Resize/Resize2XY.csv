Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a camel that scales up in size from the left image to the right image. The entity itself remains unchanged except for its size.

2. Transformation (A) shows a small fire truck on the left and an even smaller fire truck on the right. This is a reduction in size, not an increase, so it does not follow the training transformation.

3. Transformation (B) shows a small fire truck on the left and a larger version of the same fire truck on the right. This matches the training transformation, as there is an increase in size and the entity remains the same.

4. Transformation (C) shows a small fire truck on the left, but the fire truck on the right is not only larger, it is also a different type of vehicle (appears to be a larger fire engine with an extended section). This transformation involves a change in the form of the entity, not just a size increase, so it does not follow the training transformation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only transformation that shows an increase in size without changing the form of the entity, consistent with the training transformation.",0,No change
20,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"The correct answer is (A).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. The training transformation shows a camel that becomes larger from the left image to the right image. There are no other changes to the camel; its shape, proportions, and orientation remain consistent. The only transformation is a change in size.

2. Examining option (A), we see a fire truck that becomes larger from the left image to the right image. The shape, proportions, and orientation of the fire truck appear consistent between the two images, indicating that the only transformation is the increase in size.

3. Option (B) also shows a fire truck that becomes smaller from the left image to the right image, which is the opposite transformation of the training example.

4. Option (C) shows a complex transformation where the fire truck on the left becomes not only larger but also changes form to become a different style of fire truck on the right. This does not match the training transformation, which involves only an increase in size without changing the form.

Therefore, the transformation (A) follows the identified training transformation the closest, as it involves an increase in size with no other changes to the object, just like the camel example.",0,No change
20,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The ""training transformation"" involves a single camel on the left that is smaller and transforms into a larger camel on the right without any other changes in details or characteristics.

2. (A) shows a small fire truck on the left and the same fire truck on the right without any change in size or detail.

3. (B) shows a significant transformation from a smaller fire truck on the left to a larger, more detailed fire truck on the right with additional sections added to the vehicle.

4. (C) shows a small fire truck on the left that is transformed into a larger fire truck on the right without changing details or adding new characteristics, just like the camel.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the identified ""training transformation"" is (C), because both the training example and (C) exhibit an increase in size without a change in detail or additional elements.",0,0.5XY

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object increasing in size from the left image to the right image.

2. We need to find the image that portrays the same type of transformation.

3. Option (A) shows a small alien figure on the left that transforms into a larger version of the same figure on the right.

4. Option (B) shows an alien figure on the left and the right with no noticeable change in size.

5. Option (C) shows a large alien figure on the left that transforms into a smaller version of the same figure on the right.

6. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because it demonstrates the same transformation type identified in the training transformation—the object increases in size from left to right.",1,2XY
19,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object that increases in size from the left image to the right image.
2. Transformation option (A) shows no change in the size of the object; the object remains the same from left to right.
3. Transformation option (B) shows an increase in the size of the object; the object on the right is larger than the object on the left, which matches the training transformation.
4. Transformation option (C) shows a reduction in the size of the object; the object on the right is smaller than the object on the left, which is the opposite of the training transformation.
  
Given these observations, transformation option (B) is the only one that follows the identified training transformation of increasing in size from left to right.",1,2XY
19,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a simple growth in size from the left object to the right object without any other changes in appearance or properties.

2. Let's analyze each of the transformations provided:

    - (A) shows an alien figure that remains the same size from left to right.
    
    - (B) shows an alien figure that decreases in size from left to right.
    
    - (C) shows an alien figure that increases in size from left to right.

3. Since the training transformation involves an increase in size without any other changes, option (C) is the only transformation that follows the identified pattern of growth in size from left to right with no alterations in the object's characteristics. Options (A) and (B) do not conform to the training transformation as they show no transformation and a decrease in size, respectively.",1,2XY

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial example transformation shows an object (a hippopotamus) that increases in size from the left image to the right image. Thus, we're looking for a transformation where the object on the left becomes larger on the right.

2. Examining option (A), we see that the object on the right is smaller than the object on the left, which is the opposite of the example transformation, so (A) can be eliminated.

3. Looking at option (B), both objects appear to be the same size. Since there's no change in size, option (B) does not follow the example transformation, so (B) can be eliminated.

4. Observing option (C), the object on the right is larger than the object on the left. This matches the training transformation pattern identified previously; therefore, (C) is the correct transformation that follows the identified transformation.",1,2XY

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a small silhouette of a hippopotamus that becomes bigger.
2. We are looking for a transformation where an object increases in size from left to right.
3. Transformation (A) shows a large circle that becomes smaller, which is the opposite of the training transformation.
4. Transformation (B) shows a small circle that becomes larger, which matches the training transformation.
5. Transformation (C) shows two circles of the same size, so there is no change in size from left to right.

Based on these observations, transformation (B) follows the identified training transformation because it is the only transformation where the object increases in size from left to right.",1,2XY
39,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation demonstrates an object (a hippopotamus) increasing in size from the left image to the right image.
2. We need to find a transformation that also shows an increase in size from left to right.

Looking at the options:
- Option (A) shows the same size object on the left and right, so there is no transformation in size. 
- Option (B) shows the object on the right being smaller than the object on the left, which is the opposite of the training transformation.
- Option (C) shows the object on the right being larger than the object on the left, which matches the training transformation where the right side object is larger than the left one.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) since it follows the identified transformation where the object increases in size from left to right.",1,2XY

To determine which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) follows the identified training transformation, we need to compare the transformations by following certain steps.

1. Look at the training transformation: It involves an object (in this case, a cow) that becomes bigger from the left image to the right image with no other changes in shape, orientation, or additional elements.

2. Now, let's examine each provided transformation:

- Transformation (A): The object on the left becomes larger and gains an additional part (the wheels seem to be more pronounced or added) on the right. This doesn’t strictly follow the training transformation as it includes a change other than just an increase in size.
  
- Transformation (B): The object on the right is smaller than the object on the left, which is the opposite of the training transformation.

- Transformation (C): The object on the left becomes larger on the right, with no other visible changes in shape, orientation, or additional parts.

Based on this analysis, transformation (C) is the only one that strictly follows the training transformation, since the only change is the increase in size from the left image to the right image, with no other alterations.",0,No change
35,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning for choosing (A):

1. The training transformation involves an object on the left increasing in size to become the object on the right.
2. Transformation (A) shows a small object on the left and a larger version of the same object on the right. This matches the training transformation, where the object becomes bigger from left to right.
3. Transformation (B) shows the same size object on both the left and the right, so there is no change in size.
4. Transformation (C) also shows an object of the same size on both sides, with no change in size.
5. Therefore, the only transformation that follows the training transformation pattern, where the object on the left becomes bigger to become the object on the right, is (A).",1,2XY
35,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(D)

Let's analyze the provided transformation examples step by step:

1. The training transformation shows a smaller image of a cow on the left becoming a larger image of the same cow on the right. No other changes are observed between the two images.

2. Transformation (A) shows a structure that is smaller on the left and remains the same size on the right, which does not follow the training transformation where the object becomes bigger.

3. Transformation (B) shows a structure that changes in size from smaller on the left to larger on the right. However, there is also an addition of a cylindrical base in the right image that is not present in the left image. This violates the training transformation principle, which solely involves an increase in size without any other modifications.

4. Transformation (C) shows a structure that is the same size on both the left and the right, which does not match the training transformation where an increase in size should occur.

Since none of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) solely involve an increase in size without any other alteration, the correct answer is (D), indicating that none of the options correctly follow the identified transformation.",0,Doesn't apply
31,0,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(A)

The training transformation shows an object (ice cream or popsicle) on the left that is smaller and it transforms into a larger version of the same object on the right. The important aspect of the transformation is the increase in size while maintaining the same shape and proportions.

Let's analyze the transformations marked with (A), (B), and (C):

- Transformation (A) shows a small object on the left that transforms into a larger version of the same object on the right. The proportions and shape have remained consistent, and only the size has increased. This matches the training transformation.
- Transformation (B) shows a large object on the left that transforms into a smaller version of the same object on the right. The direction of the transformation is opposite to the training transformation (i.e., it's a reduction in size rather than an increase).
- Transformation (C) shows an object of a consistent size from left to right, meaning there is no change in size at all.

Therefore, the correct transformation that follows the identified training transformation is (A), which demonstrates an increase in size while maintaining the same shape and proportions.",1,2XY
31,1,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object increasing in size from the left image to the right image.

2. We are looking for the transformation among (A), (B), and (C) that most closely follows this pattern of ""becoming bigger"".

3. Transformation (A) does not follow the pattern as both objects appear to be the same size.

4. Transformation (B) also does not follow the pattern as the object on the right is smaller than the object on the left.

5. Transformation (C) shows an object on the left that is smaller and an object on the right that is larger, following the pattern of the training transformation, where the left object becomes bigger to become the right object.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the identified training transformation is (C).",1,2XY
31,2,0,2XY,0,2XY,"(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a popsicle-like object on a stick. The transformation from left to right is an increase in size, where the object on the right side is a larger version of the object on the left side.

2. We now analyze the three provided transformations to see which one aligns with the training transformation:

- (A) shows a small object on the left and a similarly sized object on the right. There's no apparent change in size.
- (B) shows a small object on the left and a larger version of the same object on the right, which matches the increase in size as per the training transformation.
- (C) shows a larger object on the left and a smaller version of the same object on the right, which is a decrease in size, opposite of the training transformation.

3. Only option (B) exhibits the same increase in size from left to right as the training transformation, making it the correct answer.",1,2XY
