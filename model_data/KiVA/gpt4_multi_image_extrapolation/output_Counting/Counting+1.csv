Here's a step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. We need to first identify the transformation that occurs from the left to the right in the training image.
2. In the training image, there are two identical balloons on the left. On the right, the number of balloons has increased from two to three, and the color changes from blue to a lighter shade (possibly depicting a reflection or glare). There is no change in size or orientation.
3. Now let's examine each of the options (A), (B), and (C) and compare them to the training transformation:

- (A): Starts with three balloons and transforms to two. This is the opposite of the training transformation, which increases in number.
- (B): Starts with three balloons and transforms to three balloons. While the number remains the same, the color changes from white to black, which does not match the training transformation.
- (C): Starts with three balloons and transforms to four. The number increases similar to the training transformation, and the color changes from black to a lighter shade (potentially white), which is similar to the color change observed in the training transformation.

Based on these observations, transformation (C) follows the training transformation most closely, as it involves changes in both the number of objects and their color - adding an object and changing from a darker to a lighter color.",0,Counting-1

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the training transformation provided at the beginning, we observe that there are two changes that occur from left to right:
   - The number of objects increases by one.
   - The color of the objects remains the same.

2. Now we examine each of the three provided transformations:

   - Transformation (A) changes the orientation of the object and its number, as there is an additional object appearing in a vertical orientation.
   - Transformation (B) changes the orientation of the object and the color, as the object on the right is of a different color and is vertical.
   - Transformation (C) increases the number of objects by one but retains color and orientation.

3. Since the training transformation involved an increase in number without changing the color, the correct option based on the training transformation is (C), where the number of objects increases by one and the color remains the same.",1,Counting+1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows two balloons on the left side becoming three balloons on the right side with the third balloon appearing between and slightly above the original two. There is no change in color, size, or orientation.

2. Option (A) shows three balloons transforming into four. While the number increases, the additional balloon is placed to the right side rather than between and slightly above the original balloons as in the training transformation.

3. Option (B) shows a transformation of one balloon to two balloons. The second balloon is placed directly above the first, which does not match the placement in the training transformation.

4. Option (C) displays a transformation from two balloons to three, with the third balloon appearing between and slightly above the original two, just like in the training transformation.

2. Option (A) shows four objects on the left transforming into five on the right. This is an increase in the number of objects by one.

3. Option (B) shows five objects on the left and five on the right, which indicates no change in the number of objects.

4. Option (C) shows six objects on the left and seven on the right. This is again an increase in the number of objects by one.

2. Now let's analyze the given transformations:

   - Transformation (A) shows an increase in the number of objects, similar to the training transformation; however, it also includes a change in the size of the objects, which is not consistent with the training transformation.

   - Transformation (B) shows exactly one more object on the right than on the left with no change in size, orientation, or color. This is consistent with the training transformation.

   - Transformation (C) shows the same number of objects on both sides and does not reflect the increase in number observed in the training transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we observe that the number of objects increases from three to five between the left and right images. There are no other changes; the size, orientation, and color of the objects remain the same.

Now let's analyze each option:

2. In option (A), the number of objects increases from one to three between the left and right images. The size, orientation, and color of the objects remain the same. This matches the training transformation in terms of an increase in object count.

3. In option (B), the number of objects increases from two to four between the left and right images. The size, orientation, and color of the objects remain the same. This also matches the training transformation's pattern of an increase in object count, but the count of objects in the left is not following the initial training transformation, since the training starts with three objects.

4. In option (C), the number of objects remains three on both the left and right images. There is no transformation in object count, which does not match the training transformation.

Since the pattern we are looking for is an increase in the number of objects without a change in size, orientation, or color, and option (A) showcases this pattern consistently, the correct choice is (A).",0,Counting-1

2. On the right side of the training transformation, there are four batteries. They have the same orientation and color as the batteries on the left but with one less in number. The spacing between the batteries seems consistent on both sides.
3. Looking at transformation (A), the apples on the left are five in number and evenly spaced in a row. On the right side, there is a single apple that is not in line with the others and appears to be floating or hanging above. This is a change in both number (from many to one) and spatial positioning (from a row to a single element above).
4. For transformation (B), there are five apples evenly spaced in a row on the left. On the right, the apples remain in the same configuration as on the left, with five apples evenly spaced. There is no change here.
5. In transformation (C), there are five apples spaced in a row on the left. On the right, the configuration is nearly the same, but there is one less apple, making a total of four apples in a row with the same spacing. This is a change in number while retaining consistent spacing, which reflects the training transformation.

2. Size: The size of the object on the right is larger compared with the sizes of the left objects.
3. Orientation and Color: No change in orientation or color.

Now let's apply this understanding to evaluate each of the transformations (A), (B), and (C).

- Transformation (A) shows five apples on the left and five apples on the right, maintaining the number and not changing size, orientation, or color. This does not match the training transformation.
- Transformation (B) shows five apples on the left and one apple on the right, thus matching the training transformation in number reduction. However, there is no increase in size, so it does not fully match the training transformation.
- Transformation (C) shows five apples on the left and four apples on the right. This shows a decrease in number, but not to the extent of the training transformation, and there is no increase in size, orientation, or color change.

1. The training transformation shows a sequence of five objects on the left that are transformed into three objects on the right. It is important to note that the change from left to right involves a reduction in the number of objects without changing their size, color, or orientation.

2. Transformation (A) shows a sequence of five apples on the left and one apple on the right but floating above the baseline, which introduces a change in position that was not part of the training transformation.

3. Transformation (B) maintains the correct number of five apples from left to right but changes the position of the center apple, lifting it above the rest, which again introduces a positional change not present in the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C) shows a sequence of five apples on the left that transforms into three apples on the right, with no change to the size, color, orientation, or position of the apples relative to a baseline.

5. Transformation (C) shows three identical donuts on the left side, which increases to four identical donuts on the right side. This matches the pattern observed in the training transformation, where the number of objects increases from the left to the right.

- (B) shows a decrease in number from three to one and an increase in size, which matches the training transformation.

- Option (C): Once again, the sequence of airplanes remains unchanged across the divider.

1. In the training transformation, two identical brown dogs increase in number from two to three while maintaining the same orientation, color, and size.

2. In transformation (A), three identical purple chairs change to two identical purple chairs. This differs from the training transformation because the number decreases rather than increases; therefore, (A) is incorrect.

3. In transformation (B), one purple chair increases to two identical purple chairs, aligning with the training transformation by showing an increase in number while maintaining the same orientation, color, and size; therefore, (B) is correct.

4. In transformation (C), three identical purple chairs increase to four identical purple chairs. While this transformation also shows an increase in number just like the training transformation, it includes a change in orientation (the chairs rotate), which is not present in the training transformation; therefore, (C) is incorrect.

Based on these observations, (B) follows the training transformation because it is the only transformation in which an object increases in number without changing its orientation, color, or size.

The training transformation appears to involve a gradual decrease in size from left to right. The stones on the left side are larger and decrease in size consistently as they move toward the right.

Looking at transformations (A), (B), and (C):

(A) - The objects (bugs) maintain the same size from left to right, there is no transformation in size, and therefore it does not follow the training transformation.
(B) - The objects (bugs) maintain the same size from left to right until the last one, which is smaller. This mostly maintains the size, with only one change at the end, which is different from the consistent decrease in size in the training transformation.
(C) - The objects (bugs) also maintain the same size from left to right, there is no transformation in size, and therefore it does not follow the training transformation.

5. Option (C) shows four insects aligned horizontally on the left and four insects aligned diagonally with a change in orientation on the right. This does not match the training transformation because the number of objects did not change, only their orientation did.

1. Training transformation: We see a row of five stones that decreases to a row of three stones while their overall size increases from left to right. The transformation involves a change in number (decreasing) and size (increasing).

2. Looking at (A): Here, there is a row of four turtles that decreases to a row of three turtles from left to right, and the turtles appear to increase in size, which follows the pattern of decreasing number and increasing size noted in the training transformation.

3. Looking at (B): There is a row of five turtles that decreases to a single turtle from left to right, and the size of the turtle increases. While this does involve a decrease in the number of objects and an increase in size, the number decreases by four instead of by two as in the training transformation.

4. Looking at (C): There is a row of four turtles which stays the same in number but the turtles turn upside down. There is no change in number or apparent increase in size; instead, the transformation involves a change in orientation.

- On the right side, there are only two objects: one standing and facing to the left and one lying down facing to the right.
- The change from left to right involves a reduction in the number of objects from six to two.

Option (A):
- There are five dice all showing the face with five dots.
- The image on the right also shows five dice all with the face of five dots.
- There is no change in the number, size, orientation, or color of the dice.

Option (B):

2. Transformations A, B, and C Analysis: All three transformations feature six dice in the ""before"" state and six dice in the ""after"" state. There is no change in the number of dice.

3. Conclusion: Since neither of the transformations (A), (B), nor (C) involve a change in the number of objects nor the sudden appearance of an object in a different orientation (e.g., falling), none of them follows the pattern of the training transformation.

2. Option (A) Transformation: On both sides of the divider, there's the same number of objects (dice), which is five. Therefore, this does not match the training transformation as there is no change in the number of objects.

3. Option (B) Transformation: Similarly, there are five objects (dice) on both sides of the divider here as well, so there's no change in the number, size, orientation, or color.

4. Option (C) Transformation: On the left side of the divider, there are five objects (dice), and on the right side, there are four objects. This reflects a reduction in the number of objects, which is consistent with the training transformation.

- The training transformation shows a single object on the left, which is then transformed to have three duplicates of the object on the right, arranged horizontally and spaced evenly. There is an increase in number but no change in size, orientation, or color.

(B) Transformation: Shows two objects on the left and duplicates these objects to have four on the right, spaced evenly horizontally. This transformation matches the training because there is an increase in the number by duplication, just like from one to three in the training.

(C) Transformation: Shows three objects on the left and one object on the right. This is a decrease in number, which is opposite to the increase observed in the training transformation.

   - Option (B) has two objects on the left and three on the right. This shows an increase in number, but it's not the transformation from one to three objects as in the training transformation.

   - (C) shows a change in orientation, with the pins on the right rotated compared to the left, which again does not match the training transformation.

(B) In transformation (B), there are five objects on the left and one object on the right. The single object that remains is in line with the center of where the five objects were arranged. This matches the training transformation, as it includes not only the reduction of the number of objects but also the right object remaining in the correct position.

1. In the training transformation, we see two brown objects on the left that appear to be basketballs. Going from left to right, one object is added, and they also change position slightly, so there are three basketballs in the end.

2. We need to identify which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) follows this pattern.

Now, let's analyze each of the three transformations (A), (B), and (C) to find the match:

- Transformation (C): There are two objects on the left that transform into three objects on the right. While this does match the 'increase in number' aspect of the training transformation, it introduces a rotation that wasn't present in the training transformation.

Upon reevaluation, it appears I prematurely concluded that transformation (C) was correct despite the rotational discrepancy.

Now, examining the given options:

- (A) Five identical yellow cars on the left transform into three identical yellow cars on the right with no change in orientation or color. Here, there's a reduction in number, but it's not by half.

Option (A) fits this criterion as it increases the number of objects from four to five without altering any of the other attributes. Option (B) shows no transformation, and option (C) involves a change in size instead of number.

- Option (A) shows two identical objects spread apart horizontally, then the same objects coming closer together vertically.

   - Option (B) shows the same five bicycles on both the left and right, indicating no change has occurred.
   - Option (C) also shows the same five bicycles on both the left and right, so again, no change has occurred.

The given 'training transformation' shows two identical images of a character, with one being a smaller version of the other. There is no change in number, orientation, or color—only a change in size.

Let's analyze each option:

- (A): The transformation shows three identical objects on the left side and also shows three identical objects on the right side. There is no change in size, number, orientation, or color. Thus, this does not follow the training transformation.
- (B): The transformation shows three identical objects on the left side and two identical objects on the right side. There is a change in number, but no change in size, orientation, or color. Thus, this does not follow the training transformation.
- (C): The transformation shows three identical objects on the left side and two identical objects on the right side. There is a change in number, but no change in size, orientation, or color. Just like in (B), this does not follow the training transformation.

Since none of the options (A), (B), or (C) reflect a transformation involving only a change in size while maintaining the number, orientation, and color the same as in the 'training transformation', the correct answer is (D), meaning none of the options apply.",0,Doesn't apply

Let's analyze the training transformation step-by-step:

1. **Size Change**: The object on the left is smaller than the object on the right. There is an increase in size.
2. **Orientation Change**: There's no orientation change; both objects on the left and the right are oriented in the same direction.
3. **Number Change**: There's no change in the number of objects; both pictures have one object.
4. **Color Change**: There's no color change; both objects maintain the same color(s).

Now looking at the provided options to see which one follows the same pattern:

- (A) shows a change in number (from two objects to one) without a change in size, orientation, or color.
- (B) shows a change in number (from one object to two) without a change in size, orientation, or color.
- (C) shows no change in number or color, but the objects on the right are larger than those on the left. There's no orientation change.

Option (C) closely follows the training transformation because it only involves a change in size without altering the number, orientation, or color of the objects.",1,Counting+1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, there are two changes occurring from the left object to the right object:
   - The number of objects is reduced: there are three objects on the left and two on the right.
   - The orientation is altered: the leftmost object on the left side has been removed, and the remaining objects have moved one step to the left in their orientation.

2. Now I'll compare each of the three provided transformations with the training transformation:

   - Option (A): The number of objects has reduced from three to two, which aligns with the training transformation. However, the remaining two objects in the right side of option (A) have not changed their relative positions; there's no evidence of a leftward shift in orientation. This does not match the training transformation completely.
   
   - Option (B): Here, the number of objects remains the same from left to right; there are three in both images. This does not align with the training transformation's reduction in number.
   
   - Option (C): The number of objects has reduced from three to two, which is consistent with the training transformation. However, like in option (A), there is no leftward shift in orientation among the remaining objects. Hence, it does not fully match the training transformation either.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation features five identical beach balls on the left side that change to a single beach ball on the right side. This indicates a change in the number of objects.

2. Option (A) has four bananas on the left side and three on the right, which shows a decrease in number by one. This does not match the training transformation, where the number decreased from five to one.

3. Option (B) has six bananas on the left and a single banana on the right, which exactly mirrors the training transformation's change in the number of objects, from multiple instances to a single instance.

4. Option (C) has five bananas on the left and four on the right. Similar to option (A), this is a decrease in number by one, which is not the same kind of transformation observed in the training image.

1. In the training transformation image, we see four copies of a ball on the left side, with sections colored differently (green, blue, yellow, and red). On the right side, we see only one copy of the same ball with the sections identically colored. This indicates that the transformation involves a change in the number of items displayed while keeping the color and orientation constant.

2. Now we examine options (A), (B), and (C).

- In option (A), there are four bananas on the left and four bananas on the right; there is no change in number, size, orientation, or color.
- In option (B), there are four bananas on the left and four bananas on the right; the size of the bananas has decreased, but the number, orientation, and color of the objects remain the same.
- In option (C), there are four bananas on the left and four bananas on the right; the color, size, and orientation remain the same, similar to option (A).

(B) presents a decrease in number similar to (A), from five crescents on the left to four on the right.

(C) also shows a reduction from five crescents on the left to four on the right.

None of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) match the training transformation exactly since the training set shows a reduction from five objects on the left to a single object on the right, whereas the three options only show a reduction from five objects to four objects.

Option (B) shows five objects remaining as five objects, so there is no transformation in the number of objects.
Option (C) shows five objects transforming into four objects, which is a reduction in number but does not match the training transformation of reducing to one object.

The training transformation illustrates three identical objects that are reduced to two identical objects in the transformed image. Specifically, the third object is being removed from the left side.

Let's analyze the given transformations (A), (B), and (C) according to the criteria determined from the training transformation:

(A) Shows three objects on the left side and three objects on the right side. The number of objects remains the same; thus, it does not follow the training transformation.

(B) Shows four objects on the left side and four objects on the right side. Similar to (A), the number of objects has not changed, so it doesn't adhere to the training transformation.

(C) Has three objects on the left side and two objects on the right side, reflecting a reduction in the number of objects. However, it's crucial to note that the rightmost object is removed instead of the leftmost one—as dictated by the training transformation. Therefore, despite the correct number change, it does not entirely follow the training transformation's rule of removing the leftmost object.

1. In the training transformation, we see two butterflies on the left: one larger and one smaller.

This indicates that the transformation involves combining the sizes of the two different butterflies into one butterfly with a size that is in between the two.

2. Looking at transformation (A), we see two flowers, one with two petals and one with three petals. On the right, we see one flower with three petals which does not reflect a combination or middle ground of the two petals counts on the left. So, this does not follow the training transformation.

3. For transformation (B), there are two flowers with two petals each on the left side, and on the right, there is one flower with three petals.

- Option (A) depicts five gray knobs on the left, transforming into three gray knobs on the right. This transformation follows the training rule by changing the number of objects while preserving their color and orientation.
  
- Option (B) depicts five gray knobs on the left, transforming into five darker gray knobs on the right. This transformation changes the color but does not reduce the number, so it does not follow the training rule.

- Option (C) shows a set of five gray knobs on the left, and it also has five on the right but with one knob being slightly offset to the top right. This transformation changes the orientation and position of one object without changing the number, so it does not follow the training rule.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. In the training transformation, we see that there are five identical objects on the left, which transform into a single object of the same type on the right. Therefore, the transformation involves reducing the number of objects from five to one.

   - In (A), there are five similar objects on the left, and this transforms into a single object on the right, just like in the training transformation.

1. The training transformation shows five identical objects on the left.

This indicates that the transformation rule involves a change in the number of objects, from multiple to a single object.

2. (A) Transformation: There are five identical objects on the left, and the same number of objects appear on the right with a change in orientation. Therefore, (A) is not following the rule of changing from multiple to a single object.

4. (C) Transformation: There are multiple objects on the left, and the same number of objects on the right with a change in orientation. Similar to (A), it does not match the training rule since the number of objects remains the same.

4. Option (B) shows five circles on the left and four circles on the right, which represents a decrease in the number of objects rather than an increase, so this does not follow the training transformation.

5. Option (C) shows three circles on the left and two circles on the right, again reflecting a decrease in the number of objects, and thus does not follow the training transformation.

2. Now let's apply that rule to the given options:

1. In the left image, there is a single green frog.
2. In the right image, there are two green frogs that are smaller than the original frog. No change in color or orientation is observed.

The transformation here involves an increase in the number of objects (from one to two) and a decrease in size. There is no change in orientation or color.

Now, let's apply this to the three provided transformations:

Option (A):
1. The left image shows two brown objects.
2. The right image shows four brown objects of smaller size.

This transformation increases the number of objects and decreases their size, matching the training transformation pattern.

Option (B):
1. The left image shows two brown objects.
2. The right image shows two brown objects of larger size.

This transformation only changes the size of the objects, and it increases rather than decreases it, which does not match the training transformation pattern.

Option (C):
1. The left image shows two brown objects.

The changes from the left to the right in the training transformation involve a decrease in size and a change in vertical position for one of the figures.

2. In the second panel of the training transformation, we observe a single bucket that is smaller than the smallest bucket from the first panel, indicating that the transformation involves decreasing the size of the object.

Now let's observe the given transformations (A), (B), and (C):

- Transformation (A) shows a set of macarons decreasing in number from left to right but not in size.
- Transformation (B) displays a set of macarons that stays the same in number from left to right and does not change in size.
- Transformation (C) presents a set of macarons decreasing in size from left to right, matching the training transformation pattern.

Based on this analysis, transformation (C) is the one that follows the training transformation because it involves a decrease in size, just like the training transformation.",1,Counting+1
48,0,3,4,3,4,-1,0,"The correct answer is (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see three objects on the left that transform into four objects on the right. This indicates an increase in the number of objects.

2. Looking at option (A), we see three objects on the left transforming into four objects on the right. This matches the increase in number from the training transformation.

3. Option (B) shows three objects on the left and three on the right, which means there is no change in the number of objects. This does not match the training transformation.

4. Option (C) also shows three objects on the left and three on the right, so again, there is no change in the number of objects, which does not match the training transformation.

Since option (A) is the only one where the number of objects increases from left to right, just as in the training transformation, it is the correct answer.",0,Counting-1
48,1,3,4,3,4,-1,0,"(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a group of three objects on the left that transform into four objects on the right. It is noted that the color, orientation, and size of the objects remain unchanged. The only transformation that has occurred is an increase in number from three objects to four.

2. Transformation option (A) shows a set of three objects on the left that transform into four objects on the right, just like the training transformation. The color, orientation, and size of the objects again remain constant.

3. Transformation option (B) shows a set of four objects on the left that remain four objects on the right. No transformation has occurred in the number, color, size, or orientation.

4. Transformation option (C) also shows a set of four objects on the left that remain four objects on the right, similar to option (B).

5. Since only option (A) replicates the increase in the number of objects without altering any other characteristics, it is the one that follows the training transformation.",1,Counting+1
48,2,3,4,3,4,-1,0,"The correct transformation is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, the left side shows four instances of the same object, and the right side shows the same four objects plus an additional one, making a total of five. This means the transformation involves increasing the number of objects by one.

2. Transformation (A) shows three objects on the left and four on the right, an increase by one, matching the training transformation in terms of number change.

3. Transformation (B) shows three objects on the left and three on the right, which means there is no change in the number of objects, so it does not match the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C) shows three objects on the left and four on the right, an increase by one, matching the training transformation in terms of number change.

5. Between transformations (A) and (C), which both increased the number of objects by one, we need to further analyze the details. Notice that in the training transformation, the added object on the right is the same in every aspect (size, orientation, color) as the existing objects.

6. Transformation (A) introduces the fourth object at a different size, which is not a match to the training transformation's addition method, as the added object in the training transformation is the same size as the original objects.

7. Transformation (C) introduces the fourth object at the same size, orientation, and color as the existing objects, exactly matching the",1,Counting+1
49,0,3,4,3,4,-1,0,"The correct transformation is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see that there is a change in number and orientation. The object on the left side has three units and the object on the right side has four units.

2. Analyzing each option:
   - (A) shows a change in number, with an increase from three objects to four; however, the orientation stays the same, which does not fully match the training transformation where both number and orientation change.
   - (B) shows a change in number, with an increase from three objects to four; the orientation also stays the same, which, again, does not fully match the training transformation.
   - (C) shows a change in number, with an increase from three objects to four; in addition to this, there is also a change in orientation where the objects on the right are facing a different direction compared to those on the left, like in the training transformation.

3. Since (C) shows changes in both number and orientation, it follows the training transformation.",1,Counting+1
49,1,3,4,3,4,-1,0,"The correct transformation letter that follows the training transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The training transformation involves three objects. From left to right, the second object is removed and the third object moves into the place where the second object was. There is no change in size, orientation, or color of the objects.
2. Now looking at option (A), from left to right, there is a change in position and orientation. This does not match the training transformation, as the training only involved the removal of an object without changing the orientation of the remaining objects.
3. For option (B), from left to right, the second object is removed and the third object moves into the place of the second object, with no change in size, orientation, or color. This matches the training transformation exactly.
4. In option (C), from left to right, the object in the middle is removed, but the first and third objects do not change their position. This does not follow the training transformation pattern either, as in the training, the last object moves into the position of where the second object was.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it follows the same transformation pattern as the training example.",0,No change

Let's analyze the transformations step-by-step:

**Training transformation:**
- We start with two objects on the left.
- On the right, we have three objects.
- We observe an increase in the number of objects from two to three.
- No other changes are noted such as color, size, or orientation.

**Transformation (A):**
- We see three objects on the left.
- On the right, there are still three objects.
- There is no change in number, size, color, or orientation.
- Transformation (A) thus does not follow the training transformation.

**Transformation (B):**
- We start with three objects on the left.
- On the right, there are still three objects.
- There is no change in number, size, color, or orientation.
- Transformation (B) does not follow the training transformation either.

**Transformation (C):**
- There are two objects on the left.
- On the right, there are three objects.
- The count of objects increases from two to three.
- There is no change in size, color, or orientation.
- Transformation (C) exactly matches the training transformation where the number of objects increases by one while other attributes remain constant.

Therefore, the correct transformation that follows the training transformation rule is (C) because it exhibits an increase in the number of objects from two to three, similar to what is observed in the training transformation.",1,Counting+1
