Let's analyze the training transformation first:
- The dog's orientation changes from standing on the ground to being upside-down.

Now let's analyze the three options:

(A) The submarine undergoes a slight rotational change but remains with the same orientation in the water (horizontal), which does not follow the training transformation that involves a more pronounced change of orientation (upside-down).

(B) The submarine is the same in both images, with no visible rotation or transformation. Hence, it does not follow the training transformation.

(C) The submarine rotates from a horizontal position in the water to a vertical position out of the water.

Option (C) correctly follows the training transformation because it involves a change in the orientation of the object from horizontal to vertical, similar to the dog's transformation from standing to upside-down.",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The training transformation shows a dog that starts in an upright, standing position and then is rotated to lie on its back. The key aspects of this transformation are a change in orientation and rotation about an axis perpendicular to the line of sight. The size, number, and color of the dog do not change.
- Transformation (A) shows a submarine that starts in a horizontal orientation and then is rotated to a vertical orientation. This transformation shows a change in orientation, analogous to the training transformation.
- Transformation (B) shows a submarine that starts in a horizontal orientation and then is flipped to face the opposite direction while remaining horizontal. This is not a match, as there is no change in the orientation relative to the gravity vector as in the training example (the submarine is still horizontal).
- Transformation (C) shows no change in the orientation or position of the object at all; the submarine looks identical in both images.

Therefore, the transformation that follows the training transformation is (A), where the object changes orientation from horizontal to vertical.",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Training transformation:
   - The dog on the left is upright and facing to the left.
   - The dog on the right is rotated onto its back and appears to be facing upwards.

2. Analyzing the provided transformations (A), (B), and (C):
   - Transformation (A): A submarine facing to the left and slightly pitched upwards on the left side transforms into a slightly larger submarine, still in the same orientation, on the right.
   - Transformation (B): A submarine facing to the left on the left side is rotated to a submarine facing upwards on the right, akin to the dog in the training transformation.
   - Transformation (C): A submarine facing to the left on the left side transforms into a slightly more elevated but still horizontally oriented submarine on the right.

2. Looking at option (A), the transformation shows the same object with no visible change in orientation, size, color, or number of the French fries. This does not match the training transformation since no rotation is involved.

3. For option (B), the transformation depicts a change in the orientation of the object. However, the fries holder has been rotated to spill the fries out, which is an additional transformation not seen in the training example.

4. Option (C) shows the fries holder rotated to its side, akin to the training transformation. There are no additional transformations such as a change in size, color, or a number of fries. This closely follows the training transformation, which also involved only a rotation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows the object rotating around its vertical axis. The object's color, size, and number of visible parts remain constant, but the orientation changes from facing left to facing right.

2. In option (A), the fries box remains in the same orientation; there is no rotation or any other change. This does not match the training transformation, which involves a change of orientation.

3. Option (B) shows the fries box after it has been rotated around its vertical axis, so the orientation of the fries changes from being vertical to spilling over to the side. This change in orientation mirrors the training transformation, where the object rotates around its vertical axis.

4. Option (C) shows a change in the orientation similar to (B), but it goes from a frontal view to a top-down view. This involves tilting the box forward rather than rotating it entirely around its vertical axis.

Thus, the transformation that follows the training transformation is (B) because it involves a rotational change around the vertical axis without altering other properties of the object, matching the training example.",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The training transformation shows a fan that rotates from an upright position to a sideways position while remaining unchanged in size, number, and color.

2. Looking at option (A), the box of fries is shown tilted onto its side, and one side of the box is now on the top, similar to the training transformation with the rotation aspect. However, option (A) also shows the fries spilling out of the box, which is a change in the configuration of the fries that does not correspond to the type of change seen in the training transformation.

3. In option (B), the box of fries is also tilted onto its side, with one side of the box ending up on top. Like option (A), the fries are spilling over, showing an alteration in the configuration of the object's contents, which, again, is not present in the training transformation.

4. Option (C) doesn't involve any change in orientation; the box of fries remains upright in both pictures, so this clearly doesn't follow the training transformation.

Since none of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) follow the training transformation strictly in terms of rotation without additional changes to the object's configuration or content, the correct answer is (D).",0,Doesn't apply

4. Option (C) shows a toy figure with a change in orientation similar to option (B), flipping to show the bottom side from the top-down view.

Option (A) most closely matches the training transformation because it involves only a slight shift in orientation without altering the size, color, or number of objects.

(A) - The object (a penguin) rotates slightly to the right but does not flip along the horizontal axis as in the training transformation.

(B) - The object undergoes a flip similar to the training transformation, changing its orientation in a way that the top of the object faces downwards and the bottom faces upwards in the second image.

2. Looking at option (A), the object undergoes a rotation, which could be a similarity to the training transformation. However, appendages appear on the object after the transformation, demonstrating a significant change that wasn't present in the training transformation.

3. In option (B), the object remains essentially the same with hardly any noticeable transformation at all. There is no rotation or orientation change; hence, it does not follow the training transformation.

To determine which transformation option follows the training transformation, let's first describe the observed transformation in the training example:

1. The object on the left is a building-like structure with a central cylindrical part and two side extensions.
2. The object on the right is the same structure, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise around its vertical axis.

The training transformation involves a rotation without any change in size, number, or color. Now, let's analyze each option:

(B) The left image shows a bunch of grapes with leaves pointing upwards. The right image is identical; there's no discernible transformation.

(C) The left image shows a bunch of grapes with leaves pointing upwards. The right image shows the grapes rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the central axis, similar to the training transformation.

Since the training transformation involves a rotation around the vertical axis with no changes to other attributes, option (C) follows the training transformation because it is the only option where the object is simply rotated without altering size, number, or color. Options (A) and (B) do not include the same kind of rotation as the training example.",1,2DRotation+90
4,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see a boat-like object on the left and a sliced section of it on the right. The transformation here involves cutting or separating a part of the object while keeping the overall appearance similar.

2. Looking at option (A), we see a bunch of grapes with leaves on the left and a similar image but with the grapes rearranged and the leaves repositioned on the right. There is no cutting or separating involved in this transformation; it is more of a reorientation and repositioning of parts of the object.

3. In option (B), we have a bunch of grapes with leaves on the left and the same bunch on the right. Here, there appears to be no change at all, meaning this would not follow the transformation pattern of changing the object that is presented in the training transformation. However, upon close inspection, we notice that the image on the right is a mirror reflection of the image on the left, as seen with the positioning of the leaves. This is a subtle change but still a transformation involving orientation.

4. For option (C), we see a bunch of grapes with leaves on the left that seem to show the bunch from one angle, and on the right, the bunch is rotated to show a different angle. The transformation involves rotating the object, which is different from the training transformation of cutting or separating parts.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Looking at the training transformation, we observe that the object undergoes a rotation about a vertical axis. The object on the left is oriented with its protruding part facing towards the left, and on the right, the same part is facing towards the right. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects; the transformation is purely a rotation.

Now let's analyze the three transformations:

- (A) shows a bunch of grapes with no visible transformation between the two images. The orientation and the number of grapes appears to remain the same.
  
- (B) also shows a bunch of grapes, but in this transformation, you can see that the leaves, which are on the right side of the stem in the first image, have moved to the left side in the second image. This indicates a rotation around a vertical axis, similar to the training transformation.

- (C) shows the bunch of grapes retaining the orientation of the leaves and grapes; there's no observable transformation.

4. Transformation (C) also shows a mouse that goes from standing on all fours to a tilted orientation on its hind legs, which is a change in orientation.

5. Both (A) and (C) depict a change in orientation, but (C) is a better match as the change in orientation from standing to tilting backward is more pronounced, similar to the training transformation where the object goes from a horizontal to a clearly more tilted position.

In the training transformation, we see that the left object (a brown block of some sort) has a visible yellow interior, while the object on the right, seemingly the same block, is rotated such that the yellow part is on top and less of the front face is visible.

Applying this observation to the options given:

(A) The mouse on the left is in profile, facing left, and the mouse on the right is rotated such that we see the back of the head and the tail is pointing more upward. However, this is not just a rotation; it's also a perspective shift from the side to almost a top view.

(B) The mouse on the left is in profile, facing left, and the mouse on the right is rotated but also seems to be in a slightly different position as the body appears smaller. This is more complex than a simple rotation; it involves a change in apparent size, which may be due to perspective.

(C) The mouse on the left is facing us in profile, and the mouse on the right is the same mouse, but rotated so that we see more of the back and less of its left side. This follows the pattern observed in the training transformation where the rotation gives us a different view of the object without changing the object's size, number, or color.

The training transformation involves a coffee cup that rotates from an upright position where the opening is facing up, to an angle where the opening is facing the viewer. There is no change in the size, color, or number of the objects; the only change is in the orientation of the coffee cup.

Now, let's evaluate the given transformations:

(A) Transformation A shows a figure that undergoes a rotation and a change in layering/overlap of parts (the tail comes in front of the face).
(B) Transformation B shows a figure that undergoes a rotation while maintaining the same layering/overlap of parts, similar to the training transformation.
(C) Transformation C shows no change in the figure's orientation or any other aspect (it remains identical).

Given that the training transformation involves a simple rotation without changing the layering, size, number, or color, option (B) most closely follows the training transformation.",1,2DRotation+90

To analyze the training transformation, let's consider the properties that have changed from the object on the left to the object on the right:

1. The orientation of the object changed from a side view to a frontal view.
2. The object remains the same size, color, and quantity.

Now let's apply these criteria to the three transformations (A), (B), and (C):

(A) The airplane's orientation changes from a side/front view to a top-down view, a different kind of change in orientation than the training transformation.

(B) The airplane's orientation also changes to a top-down view. Additionally, the color of the propeller changes from black to gray, which introduces a change that wasn't part of the training transformation.

(C) The airplane retains the same side/front view in both images, meaning there is no change in orientation at all.

Therefore, none of the three transformations (A), (B), or (C) follow the same transformation pattern as the training example. Hence, the correct answer is (D).",0,Doesn't apply

Training Transformation:

- The object on the right is a three-dimensional representation of the same object, specifically an extrusion of the two-dimensional object into the third dimension.

Now let's apply this transformation to options (A), (B), and (C):

(A) Transformation:
- The object on the left is a three-dimensional airplane.
- The object on the right is a three-dimensional airplane with its propeller facing upwards.
- This transformation involves a change in the orientation of the airplane's propeller but does not involve a two-dimensional to three-dimensional extrusion.

(B) Transformation:
- The object on the left is a three-dimensional airplane.
- The object on the right is a three-dimensional airplane that has been rotated to face the opposite direction.
- This transformation involves a change in the orientation of the entire airplane but does not follow the 2D to 3D extrusion pattern of the training transformation.

(C) Transformation:
- The object on the left is a three-dimensional airplane.
- The object on the right is the same three-dimensional airplane, but it appears to be slightly darker in color.

1. The object on the left is a three-dimensional shape of a gun.
2. The object on the right is a three-dimensional shape of a gun with a noticeable change—it has a significant part missing, giving it a cut-out appearance.

The transformation involves the removal or subtraction of part of the object, resulting in a change in the shape.

Now, let's analyze the provided transformations (A), (B), and (C):

(A) The plane on the left appears to be the same as the plane on the right, with no noticeable transformation in size, orientation, number, or color. Therefore, it does not follow the training transformation.

(B) The plane on the left is whole, while the plane on the right is missing a part of its tail section, similar to the cut-out effect observed in the training transformation.

(C) The plane on the left is whole, while the plane on the right is also whole with no parts missing or added, no change in size, orientation, or color. However, upon closer inspection, we can observe that there is a change that reflects the training transformation; in (C), the propeller of the plane has changed orientation—it has rotated. This subtle change is consistent with the training transformation because it involves a change in the orientation of a part of the object, rather than its entirety.

Let's analyze the training transformation first:

- The object (a green hat) is rotating.
- There is no change in size, number, or color.
- The orientation changes from an upright position to a tipped over position, nearly upside-down.

Now, let's analyze the transformations in each option:

(A) The object is a piece of furniture, and it rotates along a vertical axis, shifting the angle we view the shelves from. However, the orientation of the shelves themselves doesn't change relative to the overall object—they remain in the same configuration, just viewed from a different angle.

(B) The object here also rotates, but this time the rotation causes a change in the relative orientation of the shelves, similar to the hat tipping over in the training transformation. The shelves that were originally vertical are now horizontal, and the shelf that was horizontal is now vertical.

(C) The object here only slightly shifts its orientation; the relative position of the shelves to the overall object remains the same.

Based on the above observations, the rotation in (B) changes the relative orientation of parts of the object just like the hat's transformation, where the top of the hat becomes the side.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The ""training transformation"" shows a rotation of the object, in this case, a green hat. The hat is rotated around its vertical axis.

2. Let's observe the three transformations:

- Transformation (A) shows a bookshelf that has undergone some sort of rotation but also appears to have a slight perspective change or structural alteration as the angle of the side compartments has changed, which is not consistent with a simple rotation.

- Transformation (B) shows a bookshelf that is rotated around what appears to be its vertical axis, similar to the way the hat in our training transformation was rotated. This is a consistent transformation with the training image.

- Transformation (C) shows a bookshelf that is rotated, but it is not just a rotation around the vertical axis; it also appears to have been rotated around a horizontal axis as well, as the orientation of the shelves has changed from horizontal to vertical.

4. Option (B) shows a shelf that seems to have been rotated counter-clockwise, which is again not the same direction as the rotation in the training sample.

5. Option (C) depicts a shelf rotated similarly to the hat in the training sample - a 90-degree clockwise rotation with a similar change in perspective.

To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the provided training transformation first, and then apply that to the three options given.

Training transformation:
- The object on the left is a two-way radio or walkie-talkie.
- The object on the right is the same walkie-talkie, but instead of being upright, it has been rotated 90 degrees to the right, so it's lying on its side. 

The transformation involves a change in orientation but not in size, number, or color.

Now let's assess each option:

(A) Shows a three-layer birthday cake that has been rotated, but not in a manner consistent with the training. The cake is rotated looking as if from the top view, making a different transformation than the one in the training image.

(B) Once again shows a three-layer birthday cake that seems to have been rotated and also slightly changed the perspective to a more angled top view, which again is not consistent with the training transformation.

(C) Displays a three-layer birthday cake that has not been transformed at all since there is no change in orientation, size, color, or number; both images in this transformation are identical.

Since neither (A) nor (B) show a simple rotation similar to the training example without altering the perspective, and (C) shows no change (and maintaining the original orientation without any alteration follows the criteria given that the training transformation only involved a change in orientation), the correct answer is:

(C) This option correctly follows the",0,No change

2. The transformation indicates a 90-degree rotation around a horizontal axis to make the object lay flat on its back.
3. There are no other changes in the number, size, or color of the object.

Now, let's look at the three given transformations:

- Transformation (A) shows a cake that rotates around a horizontal axis, resulting in an upside-down position of the cake from the viewer's perspective. This matches the kind of rotation we observed in the training transformation.

- Transformation (B) shows a cake rotated, but it's slightly askew and not simply laid on its back or rotated around a horizontal axis. It's more like the cake is viewed from a different angle, suggesting a tilt rather than a clean horizontal rotation.

The relative position of objects is retained, and there's a noticeable reduction in complexity. Size and overall color remain consistent.

2. Analyzing option (A), we notice that the object on the left—a power drill—has flipped horizontally and slightly changed in angle to become the object on the right. This transformation involves a change in orientation and perspective but does not involve a simplification or a reduction in the number of elements.

3. Looking at option (B), the power drill on the left appears to rotate to a vertical orientation in the object on the right. This transformation suggests a change in orientation but, similar to (A), does not exhibit a simplification or a reduction in complexity or components.

4. In option (C), the power drill on the left appears in a full view, while the power drill on the right seems to be missing some parts, reducing the complexity of the object.

Option (B) matches the training transformation most closely because it involves a rotation (change in orientation) of the object without altering its size, color, or number.

1. The training transformation shows an airplane that has been rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise and slightly tilted forward (so its nose is pointing down).

2. Now let's examine the three options given:

   - Transformation (A) shows a shoe that has been rotated in a similar manner to the training transformation: the shoe is turned such that its sole faces the viewer, replicating the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation seen in the training transformation.

   - Transformation (B) also shows a rotation, but it's not as extreme as the one in the training transformation or option (A). The shoe is only tilted, with the sole not directly facing the viewer.

   - Transformation (C) shows no change at all; the shoe remains in the same orientation and position.

3. Based on the training transformation, we are looking for a left-to-right transformation that includes a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation with a downward tilt.

2. Transformation (A) shows a scooter with riders that are flipped horizontally (mirrored) along the vertical axis. This is not the same as the training transformation, which involved a rotation and change of perspective.

3. Transformation (B) shows the scooter with riders rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, and the perspective is changed to view it from the top, similar to the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C) shows the scooter with riders that are rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise. This is not the same as the training transformation, which involved a counterclockwise rotation.

- In the training transformation, the elephant on the left transforms into what appears to be a simplified or stylized version of itself on the right. The transformation involves simplifying the shape of the elephant while maintaining its orientation and overall color.

- In transformation (A), the orientation of the scooter and riders changes from the left to the right image. This is not consistent with the training transformation, where orientation is maintained.

- In transformation (B), the scooter and riders are in the same orientation on the left and on the right. The change is a simplification of the shape, similar to how the elephant was simplified in the training example.

- In transformation (C), the orientation remains the same, but there is no noticeable simplification or stylization from left to right.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an elephant that rotates and becomes abstract sculpture-like. The main aspects of the transformation include rotation and deformation/reconfiguration of the shape.

2. In option (A), the transformation shows a toy motorbike with a rider that is rotated. However, there are no changes to the form or structure of the objects, so it does not fully match the training transformation.

3. In option (B), the transformation also shows a toy motorbike with a rider, similar to (A), but in the second image of (B), the rider has rotated in relation to the bike, which now has a different orientation. This implies a deformation/reconfiguration relative to the components, more similar to the training transformation.

4. In option (C), we see a toy motorbike with a rider that is rotated, with no deformation/reconfiguration of the shape or relation between the rider and bike.

Therefore, while none of the options involve deformation/reconfiguration of the objects themselves to the same extent as seen in the elephant transformation, option (B) is the best match because it features reconfiguration of the rider's position relative to the motorbike, which is closer to the concept of the training transformation.",0,No change

1. The training transformation depicts an animated character that transitions from an upright standing position to a horizontal sleeping position.
   
2. The primary changes we notice are:
   - The character's orientation changes from vertical to horizontal.
   - The character's state changes from alert and standing to sleeping (implied by the closed eyes and relaxed posture).

3. Now looking at the three given transformations:
   - (A) shows a snake that transitions from a coiled position to a more relaxed position, similar to the character that goes from standing to sleeping.
   - (B) shows a snake with no discernible change in orientation or state; the snake remains coiled in both images.
   - (C) shows a snake changing orientation from coiled facing left to coiled facing upward, but without a change in state.

4. Comparing these transformations with the training transformation, we find that (A) follows the training transformation most closely, as it reflects a shift in the state of the object from active to restful. The snake goes from a tight coil (suggesting alertness or active position) to a more relaxed and extended coil, mirroring the character's shift from standing to sleeping.

1. The training transformation shows a character that rotates and changes position relative to the camera. In the initial image, the character is upright and facing the viewer; in the transformed image, the character is lying on its back, oriented from left to right, and the bottom side is now visible.

2. We need to find a transformation that matches this rotation and change of visible sides.

3. Looking at the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C), we need to identify which one has a similar kind of rotation and change of visible sides.

4. Transformation (A) shows a snake that rotates and changes its position relative to the camera. Initially, the snake is coiled with its head pointed upwards; in the transformed image, the snake is coiled differently with its head pointing towards the camera, showing a different side of the snake's body, which matches the type of change seen in the training transformation.

5. Transformations (B) and (C) do not display the same type of rotation or change of visible sides. Transformation (B) appears to simply be closer to the camera without a significant rotation, while in (C), the snake also changes its coiling pattern but without a rotation that reveals a different side.

We need to identify a transformation among the options (A), (B), and (C) that features a similar change in orientation.

(A) shows a guitar that remains unchanged from left to right. There's no transformation in size, orientation, number, or color. Hence, this does not follow the training transformation.

(B) shows a guitar that changes its orientation from vertical to horizontal. This is similar to the training transformation in that only the orientation of the object is altered while all other attributes remain the same.

(C) shows a guitar that seemingly changes in size from left to right; the guitar on the right appears larger with perspective suggesting that it is closer. This does not reflect the same type of change in orientation demonstrated in the training transformation.

3. Transformation (B): The guitar is changed in orientation—it is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise while also being flipped horizontally. Although there is a rotation involved, the direction of the rotation and the added flip do not match the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C): The guitar is rotated in a manner that mirrors the rotation of the lion in the training transformation. It has been rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, similar to the lion's transformation in the training image.

- First, let's identify the transformation in the training set. On the left, there is a flat, partially folded object, and on the right, the same object is now fully folded to form a more three-dimensional shape. The key aspects of this transformation appear to be a change in the orientation of the object and a change from a less to a more three-dimensional structure.

Now let's analyze each of the options given:

(A) This transformation shows a frog facing forward in both images. There is no significant change in orientation, size, number, or color. The frog's pose changes slightly, but it does not correspond closely with the training transformation.

(B) In this option, the frog has been reoriented such that it is now facing up, with a slight change in perspective as well. However, this does not show a transformation from a less to a more three-dimensional structure like the training transformation.

(C) Here, the frog on the left is in a typical resting posture, while the frog on the right is upside down, in a more compact, three-dimensional posture. This is conceptually similar to the training transformation, where an object that's relatively flat becomes more three-dimensional by changing its orientation.

Given that (C) presents a transformation from a less to a more three-dimensional structured position through a change in orientation, it is consistent with the training transformation. Options (A) and (B) do not fully replicate",0,2DRotation180

In the training transformation, we observe that the object rotates and also changes its form as certain parts are folded inwards or outwards. There is no change in color or number, and while the overall size appears roughly consistent, the rotation and deformity of parts significantly alter its shape.

Now we'll compare this to the following transformations:

(A) Shows a frog that rotates to face the other direction, with no other changes observed. There is no deformation of parts similar to the training transformation.
(B) Shows the exact same image of a frog without any transformation at all. Thus, it cannot be similar to the training transformation which includes rotation and change in form.
(C) Shows a frog that has been rotated and is now upside down. While this does include rotation, there's no alteration in the frog's shape as observed in the training transformation.

None of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) match the training transformation, which includes both a rotation and a significant change in the shape of the object due to parts of it being folded.

(C) The left-to-right transformation of the object involves a rotation about the handle, essentially flipping the object on its axis, which is not analogous to the training transformation. The training transformation involves the camel lying down, not just rotating or flipping.

3. Option (B) shows the same object but now the orientation has changed from standing upright to lying flat with the handle pointing towards the right. This shows a change in orientation similar to the training transformation.

4. Option (C) also shows the object changing orientation; however, it rotates in such a way that the handle now points upwards and the flails are lying flat. This change in orientation is not quite the same as the training transformation, which showed a complete flip onto the back but maintained the same 'plane' (the camel's belly is still parallel to the ground; it does not rotate around its spine).

Even though options (B) and (C) both include a rotation, neither replicate the exact type of transformation seen in the training example (the camel's entire body is flipped while staying parallel to the same plane).

1. In the training transformation, we see that the object (a house) is rotated counterclockwise and slightly to the left from its original upright position. Additionally, the house is flipped horizontally, so its right side in the original image becomes the left side in the transformed image.

2. Now let's look at the transformations marked as (A), (B), and (C).

- (A) shows a figure that is flipped upside down but not rotated horizontally.
- (B) shows a figure that remains the same as the original, with no changes in orientation or position.
- (C) shows a figure that is rotated counterclockwise and flipped horizontally, similar to the house in the training transformation.

1. The object is a house.
2. The transformation involves a rotation about the horizontal axis, resulting in the house being upside-down in the second image.
3. There is no change in size, color, or number of houses.

Now, let's analyze the options presented:

2. The transformation involves the figure flipping upside down and also a rotation to face the opposite direction.

1. The training transformation shows a bicycle that rotates along its horizontal axis from an upright position to an inverted position. The size, number, and color of the bicycle remain unchanged.

2. Looking at the three given transformations (A), (B), and (C):
   - Transformation (A) shows a duck that is rotated along its horizontal axis similar to the way the bicycle is rotated in the training transformation.
   - Transformation (B) shows a duck that is mirrored across a vertical axis, which is a different kind of transformation than the rotation observed in the training transformation.
   - Transformation (C) shows a duck that is both rotated and altered in orientation to lay on its side, which includes an additional change in orientation not present in the training transformation.

3. Since transformation (A) is the only transformation that exhibits the same type of rotation as the training transformation, without any additional changes such as mirroring or repositioning, it follows the training transformation most closely.",0,2DRotation180

- In (A), the rubber duck goes from upright to laying on its side. This is a change in orientation, which matches the type of transformation in the training example. However, there is also a change in the position of the duck's wing, which adds a different variable to the transformation.
- In (B), the rubber duck remains in the same orientation and there is no change at all. This does not match the training transformation because there is no change in orientation.
- In (C), the rubber duck shifts from standing to lying on its back, which is another change in orientation similar to the bicycle being flipped upside down.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see that the bicycle's position has been altered from a normal standing position to being upside down while maintaining its structural integrity (no parts have been added or removed, and it has not been resized or recolored).

2. We need to find a transformation among the options (A), (B), and (C) that mirrors this kind of change. 

- Transformation (A) shows a rubber duck that has been flipped upside down but also deformed in a way that the head and tail of the duck are now at the bottom. This introduces a change in the structure, which does not follow the training transformation.
  
- Transformation (B) depicts a rubber duck that has been rotated backward, so its tail is now where its head used to be. There has been no deformation or any other changes to the duck except for orientation, which is consistent with the training transformation.
  
- Transformation (C) shows a rubber duck that has been mirrored, so its head has shifted sides but is still oriented upward, similar to the original position. This does not follow the training transformation as the original object has been mirrored rather than rotated into a new orientation.

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer because it involves only a change in orientation without alteration to the object's size, color, or structure, just like the training transformation involving the bicycle.",1,2DRotation+90

A. No transformation occurs; the flower is identical on both sides.
B. The flower on the right is rotated relative to the flower on the left, indicating a change in orientation.
C. There is no clear change in orientation; instead, the flower on the right has been shifted to a different location relative to the left image, keeping the same orientation, which does not match the training transformation.

Option (A):
- The left image shows the flower with the petals facing upward. The right image shows the flower in the same orientation, with no changes in size, number, or color. Therefore, no transformation has occurred.

Option (B):

Option (C):
- The left image shows the flower with the petals facing upward. The right image shows the flower flipped upside down, with the petals now facing downward. This involves a flip rather than a rotation, so although there is a change of orientation, the nature of the transformation is different from the training example.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Firstly, let's analyze the training transformation provided by the images of the object (probably a lounge chair or similar):

1. Orientation Change: The transformation involves a rotation, as the object's orientation in the left image is different from the orientation in the right image.
2. No Size Change: The object's size appears to remain consistent between the two images.
3. No Number Change: There is only one object in each image, so there is no change in the number of objects.
4. No Color Change: The color of the object stays the same.

Now let's examine the three left-to-right transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) to find a match with the training transformation characteristics:

- (A) shows a flower: The orientation of the flower remains the same, and the color and size are consistent. However, the image on the right has lost a leaf compared to the image on the left, decreasing the number of leaves. This does not match the training transformation.
- (B) shows a flower with no change in the number of petals or leaves, no change in orientation, and the color remains consistent. Thus, it matches none of the aspects of the training transformation.

The training transformation features an object (a rabbit figurine) that rotates from an upright position to a prone position along the horizontal axis without changing its size, number, or color.

(A) The ice cream scoop arrangement appears to remain unchanged between the two images. There's no rotation or alteration detectable.
(B) The ice cream scoops appear to rotate slightly clockwise, but the transformation is not the same as the training transformation because the object does not rotate to a prone position; it only slightly changes its orientation.
(C) The ice cream scoop with the pink topping is turned upside down. This is a rotation along the vertical axis, not the horizontal axis as seen in the training transformation.

The changes observed are in the orientation of the rabbit—specifically, it has been rotated to lay flat on its back.

2. Now, let's look at the three transformation options:
   - (A) Shows scoops of ice cream on a cone, with the ice cream oriented vertically from left to right. There's no change in the orientation, just the view angle.

   - (C) Shows the ice cream as well, and like (A), there's no change in the orientation of the ice cream scoops, just the view angle is changed.

Training Transformation:
1. The object, which appears to be a figurine of a rabbit on a circular base, changes from standing upright to lying on its back.
2. The orientation of the object changes, but the number, size, and color remain constant.

Now, let's compare this to each of the transformations (A), (B), and (C).

(A) Transformation:
1. The object, which seems to be a bowl of ice cream with multiple scoops on top, does not change the orientation between the two pictures.
2. The number, size, and color of the scoops also remain constant.
This transformation does not follow the training transformation because there is no change in orientation.

(B) Transformation:
1. The object, which appears to be the same bowl of ice cream with multiple scoops, changes orientation from the left view to a view from the top-right, similar to the training transformation.
2. However, upon closer observation, it appears that not only the orientation has changed, but also the overall configuration, since the bowl seems to have been rotated at an angle that is inconsistent with a simple turn similar to the training transformation and the positioning of the scoops has slightly adjusted.
Thus, the change here is not merely a rotation; some positional changes also occur, which makes it different from the simple orientation change in the training transformation.

2. Comparing transformation (A): The cat on the left is upright, and on the right, it is upside down. It has been rotated more than the rooster was in the training transformation, which was about 90 degrees.

3. Comparing transformation (B): In this transformation, the cat appears in the same orientation on both the left and the right, implying there was no rotation or any other visual change.

4. Comparing transformation (C): The cat on the left is shown upright, while the cat on the right has been rotated clockwise, in a manner similar to the training transformation involving the rooster. It appears to be a rotation of approximately 90 degrees toward the right lower corner of the image frame without any changes in size, number, or color.

(C) In this transformation, the chair on the left is standing normally, and in the image on the right, the chair has been rotated 90 degrees to the right and is now upside down. This closely matches the 90-degree rotation seen in the training transformation.

Looking at the training transformation, we can observe the following changes from the left object to the right object:

1. Orientation: The object is rotated to the right.
2. Size: The object remains the same size.
3. Number: The object splits into two separate parts.
4. Color: The colors remain constant throughout the transformation.

Now applying these observations to the other transformations:

(A) The giraffe is flipped and rotated but does not split into separate parts. This transformation only has a change in orientation.
(B) The giraffe remains the same in both the left and right images with no observable transformation.
(C) The giraffe is rotated to the right and splits into a separate part, which is the leg. This transformation involves both a change in orientation and number, as per the training transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we observe that the kayak is rotated around a vertical axis that goes through the middle of the kayak. This rotation makes the kayak point upwards, with its bottom facing the viewer.

2. Now let's observe the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C):
   - In (A), the guitar hasn’t changed its orientation. It remains flat with only a positional change from left to right.
   - In (B), the guitar is rotated, but it is rotated around an axis perpendicular to the one in the training transformation. This makes the guitar appear sideways and doesn't match the bottom-facing perspective change observed in the kayak transformation.
   - In (C), the guitar is rotated in a manner similar to the kayak, around a vertical axis, presenting the back of the guitar towards the viewer, which replicates the same type of rotation seen in the training transformation.

Therefore, transformation (C) is the only one that follows the same pattern observed in the training transformation.",0,2DRotation180

To solve this visual puzzle, let's first analyze the training transformation.

1. The kayak in the left picture is oriented with the front facing the upper left and the rear facing the bottom right. In the right picture, the kayak is rotated in a way that the front now points to the upper right, and the rear points to the bottom left. This indicates the kayak has been rotated roughly 90 degrees counterclockwise around its center.

2. The color, size, and number of kayaks remain unchanged. Only the orientation has been altered.

Now let's compare the transformations (A), (B), and (C) to this training transformation, focusing on orientation.

(A) The guitar on the left is horizontally oriented, with the neck pointing to the left. The guitar on the right is vertically oriented, with the neck pointing upwards. This is a rotation, but not the same as the training transformation.

(B) The guitar on the left is horizontally oriented, with the neck pointing to the left. The guitar on the right is oriented with the neck pointing down to the left, which is consistent with a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation around the center of the guitar, similar to the training transformation.

(C) The guitar on the left is horizontally oriented, with the neck pointing to the left. The guitar on the right is oriented with the neck pointing up to the left, which is not consistent with the training transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B)",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a kayak that rotates approximately 90 degrees clockwise from its original position. No other changes such as size, color, or number of objects occur in this transformation.

Looking at the three options:

2. Transformation (A): The guitar has been flipped horizontally, creating a mirror image effect. This is not a rotation, so it does not follow the training transformation of a simple rotation.

3. Transformation (B): The guitar rotates approximately 90 degrees clockwise, like the training transformation. There are no other changes in terms of size or color, and the number of guitars remains the same.

4. Transformation (C): The guitar looks the same before and after, with no noticeable transformation. Therefore, it doesn't follow the rotational change observed in the training transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see a butterfly that has rotated approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise around its head from the left image to the right image. The color and size of the butterfly are unchanged, and the number of butterflies remains the same (one butterfly in both images).

2. Now looking at the transformation options:
   - (A) shows a fox-like object that has flipped over from left to right, changing its orientation from standing to being on its back. This is not just a rotation around a point; it's a change from an upright to an inverted position.
   - (B) shows a fox-like object that has rotated slightly counter-clockwise (considering the head as the pivot point, similar to the butterfly), maintaining the same upright orientation. The color, size, and number of objects stay consistent.
   - (C) shows the fox-like object with no transformation in terms of rotation or flip; it is merely a mirrored version of itself along the vertical axis.

3. The transformation in (B) most closely follows the training transformation, as it involves a rotation around the object's head without altering any other properties of the object, like color, size, or number. The other options either change the orientation significantly, as seen in (A), or reflect the object without rotating it, as seen in (C).",0,2DRotation180
39,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, we need to identify the nature of the training transformation with the two images of the butterfly. Looking closely, the butterfly on the left appears to be upright, with its wings spread in a natural position. The butterfly on the right has been rotated counter-clockwise and is now positioned with its wings pointing upwards.

2. Option (A) shows two images of a fox. The fox on the right is the same as the fox on the left; there is no rotation or other change. Therefore, option (A) does not follow the training transformation.

3. Option (B) also shows two images of a fox. The fox on the right is rotated relative to the fox on the left, similar to the butterfly transformation. However, to check for the right match, we need to observe the direction of the rotation. In the training transformation, the butterfly has been rotated counter-clockwise, so we expect to see a counter-clockwise rotation. The right image of the fox in (B) does appear to be rotated counter-clockwise compared to the left image, lying on its back with the belly facing up. This matches the training transformation.

4. Option (C) shows two images of a fox. The fox on the right is a mirrored image of the fox on the left, not simply rotated. This does not follow the same rotation transformation seen with the butterfly, so option (C) does not match the",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Training Transformation Analysis: In the training transformation, we observe a butterfly whose position has been rotated along its central axis from the left image to the right image without any changes in size, number, or color.

2. Option (A) Analysis: The left object, which appears to be a fox, has transformed into several smaller parts. This indicates a change in the integrity of the object, which does not match the training transformation.

3. Option (B) Analysis: The left object, also depicting a fox, appears to be rotated in a similar manner to the training transformation. There is no change in size, number, or color, only a change in orientation, making this consistent with the training transformation.

4. Option (C) Analysis: This image shows the fox rotated and also slightly tilted or bent, which is an additional change beyond what is shown in the training transformation.

Given these observations, the only transformation that matches the training example in regards to an orientation change without alterations to size, number, or color is option (B).",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an object that rotates. The object in the left picture is oriented with its top facing diagonally up and to the left. In the right picture, the same object is rotated so that its top is facing diagonally up and to the right.

2. Now let's analyze the provided transformations:
   - (A) shows an object that seemingly tilts backward slightly, but this transformation does not involve a clear rotation like in the training example.
   - (B) shows no visible change in the orientation or any other aspect of the object.
   - (C) is similar to (A) with a slight apparent tilting but again lacks a clear rotation.

3. None of the options (A), (B), or (C) display a transformation that involves the same type of rotation present in the training transformation. They show variations in perspective rather than rotation.

3. In transformation (B), similarly, there is no observable change in the sandwich when comparing the left and right images. No rotation, change in size, or number occurs.
4. Transformation (C) also shows no change in the sandwich when comparing the left and right images.

(B) The sandwich here remains unaltered; there is no change in orientation, size, number, or color.

Step-by-step reasoning for my choice:

1. Training Transformation Analysis:
- The object on the left is upright and faces forward.
- The object on the right is on its back and rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise from the perspective of the original orientation. The number of visible legs remains unchanged. The colors and the size of the object seem to remain unchanged as well.

2. Transformation (A) Analysis:
- The object transforms from a side view to another side view that appears to be mirrored along a vertical axis. This is not the same transformation observed in the training transformation.

3. Transformation (B) Analysis:
- The object on the left appears to have been rotated slightly towards the viewer and flipped upside down. However, it does not match the training transformation, as there's not a 90-degree rotation in the plane that would place the object on its back.

4. Transformation (C) Analysis:
- The object on the left is upright.
- The object on the right has been rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise and placed on its back, matching the orientation change seen in the training transformation.

Considering these observations, the transformation that follows the training transformation is (C), as it matches the orientation change observed in the initial training transformation.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning for choice (C):

1. The training transformation shows that the object (a backpack) on the left is upright, and in the image on the right, the object is on its side. This transformation indicates a change in orientation.

2. We must identify which of the three transformations (A), (B), or (C) follows this same pattern of change, which is a change in orientation from the left image to the right image.

3. Transformation (A) shows a crab-like object with the left image having the object facing upward, and the right image also has the object facing upward but viewed from a slightly different angle. The orientation has not fundamentally changed as it is still upright in both images, so this does not follow the training transformation.

4. Transformation (B) shows a crab-like object, similar to (A), with the left image having the object facing upward, and the right image also has the object facing upward but from the front. Again, the orientation of the object remains largely unchanged, so this does not follow the training transformation.

5. Transformation (C) shows the crab-like object in the left image facing upward, and in the right image, the object is on its side. This represents a change in orientation, similar to the one observed in the training transformation.

Given the analysis above, transformation (C) is the correct answer because it is the only option where a change in orientation has occurred, from an upright to a",0,No change

1. Let's examine the training transformation first. We have a vertically oriented red backpack with green straps on the left, and on the right, the backpack is lying on its back (horizontally oriented) with the same colors and number of straps, essentially unchanged except for orientation.

2. Now let's analyze transformations (A), (B), and (C).

- In (A), the object (which appears to be a fly or bee-like creature) is facing to the left in the first image and has rotated to face the viewer in the second image. This is a change in orientation.
- In (B), the object is facing to the left in the first image and changes orientation to face upwards in the second image. This is also a change in orientation, but in a different axis compared to transformation (A).
- In (C), the object is unchanged between the first and second images; it remains in the same orientation and position with no discernible differences.

3. Since the training transformation involved changing the orientation of the object but keeping other aspects such as color and shape the same, option (C) is the one that follows the same principle. There's no change in orientation, and no visible changes to the color, size, or number of elements.

2. Size: The size of the croissant remains unchanged.
3. Number: There is only one croissant in both the before and after images, so the number remains the same.
4. Color: The color of the croissant does not change.

Now, let's examine each of the given transformations (A), (B), and (C) with these parameters in mind:

(A): The orientation and position of the flowers remain the same, the number of flowers remains the same, and the color does not change. Therefore, this does not follow the training transformation.

(B): The plant tilts from an upright position to a tilted position similar to the change in orientation of the croissant. The number, size, and color remain the same. This transformation mirrors the training transformation in terms of orientation change without altering other factors.

(C): The plant rotates to face upward. While this is an orientation change, it does not match the specifics of the left-to-right flip observed in the training transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the training transformation on the top, it shows a cupboard that is first vertical and then transforms to being horizontal with its door open. The main characteristics of the transformation are a change in orientation from vertical to horizontal and a state change (door going from closed to open).

2. Now let's apply this to the three sets of images below:
- (A) shows a stuffed animal that is upright and then is lying down in the second image. This matches the orientation change from the training transformation. However, there isn't a state change equivalent to the opening of the cupboard door.
- (B) shows a stuffed animal that is sitting upright and then is substantially in the same position but with one arm and one leg lifted. This maintains the orientation (upright) but demonstrates a state change with the movement of the limbs, which is more similar to the cupboard's door opening in the training transformation.
- (C) shows a stuffed animal that appears identical in both the left and right images with no changes in orientation or state.

3. The closest transformation that matches the training transformation (orientation change and state change) is:
- (B) because it shows a state change while maintaining the same orientation, making it analogous to the cupboard that also displayed a state change (door opening) without changing its base orientation (still lying flat).",1,2DRotation+90
47,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct answer here is (B). 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see a cabinet with its door closed on the left, and the same cabinet with its door opened on the right. The transformation shows a change in orientation of part of the object (the door).

2. Among the options given:

- (A): A teddy bear is shown on the left side facing towards the observer, while on the right side, the same teddy bear is shown from the top view. There is a change in orientation of the whole object.
  
- (B): A teddy bear is facing towards the observer on the left, and on the right, the bear is still facing the observer but has raised one arm and one leg (assuming a different pose). This indicates a change in orientation of parts of the object, much like the door's movement in the training transformation.
  
- (C): The teddy bear on the left is facing towards the observer, and the bear on the right is the same but slightly shifted to the right. There is no change in orientation or other noticeable attribute between these two images; it's simply a shift in position.

3. Therefore, since transformation (B) involves a change in orientation of parts (but not all) of the object, it best follows the principle observed in the training transformation. The other transformations either involve a change in orientation of the entire object (A) or just a change in",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the training transformation, we see a shelf that is initially vertical on the left side and is then laid horizontally on the right side. The transformation is a change in orientation from vertical to horizontal.

2. Now let's look at the transformations marked (A), (B), and (C) to identify which one follows the same type of transformation:
- (A) shows a teddy bear in the same orientation and position in the before and after images. There is no change in orientation in this transformation.
- (B) shows a teddy bear that is initially sitting upright and in the after image, it has been laid on its back. This demonstrates a change in orientation from upright to horizontal, which is similar to the training transformation.
- (C) shows a teddy bear that has been rotated to face upward, but the change is more of a roll rather than a flip from vertical to horizontal.

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer since it follows a transformation in orientation similar to the training transformation.",1,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. In the training transformation, we see that the object on the left (a submarine) becomes a vertical version of the same type of object on the right. The transformation involved a rotation of 90 degrees.

2. Let's analyze the transformations in the given options:

- (A) shows a fish with a specific orientation on the left, and the right image shows the fish with a mirrored orientation along the vertical axis. There is no rotation involved here; it is simply a reflection.
  
- (B) does not show any change at all. The left and right images contain a fish in the same orientation and position.

- (C) also shows a fish which stays the same from left to right. Again, the orientation and position do not change.

Therefore, none of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) follows the training transformation, which was a 90-degree rotation. The correct answer is (D), as none of the options apply.",0,Doesn't apply
48,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see a submarine that is horizontal on the left and then vertical on the right. The object undergoes a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise. There is no change in size, number, or color between the two pictures of the submarine.

2. Looking at the three options:
   - (A) shows a fish that is facing left in the first image and facing right in the second image. This is a horizontal flip, not a rotation.
   
   - (B) shows a fish that is facing left and slightly downward in the first image and facing upward in the second image. The fish has been rotated about 90 degrees counterclockwise, which matches the rotation observed in the training transformation.
   
   - (C) shows a fish that is facing left and slightly downward in the first image and slightly to the right in the second image. This is another horizontal flip with a slight vertical shift, not a rotation.

3. Option (B) is the only one that follows the training transformation rule, which is the 90-degree rotation without changes in size, number, or color.",0,2DRotation180

To determine which transformation follows the training transformation, let's analyze each pair of objects one by one:

1. In the training image, we observe a horizontal submarine on the left that transforms into a vertical submarine on the right. The color remains constant, the size is unchanged, and the number of submarines is still one. The only change is the orientation from horizontal to vertical.

2. Let's examine each of the three additional pairs labeled (A), (B), and (C) with the same criteria:
   - For (A), the left image shows a fish oriented diagonally bottom-left to top-right. On the right side, the same fish is now oriented diagonally top-left to bottom-right. The size, color, and number of fish remain unchanged. The transformation is a change in orientation.
   - For (B), the left image displays the same fish as seen in (A), and the right image also shows the same orientation as the left image. No transformation seems to have taken place.
   - For (C), the orientation of the fish from left to right is identical, which indicates there is no transformation happening in terms of orientation or any other observable feature.

Hence, only (A) shows a transformation consistent with the training transformation, where the change is solely in the orientation of the object while all other properties remain the same.",0,2DRotation180
49,0,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(C)

The training transformation shows a ship on the left that has been rotated clockwise and slightly modified on the right. The ship has been sliced in half vertically, and one half has been laid down on its side so that what was the right side of the ship is now facing upwards.

Transformation (A) and (B) are not correct because they also involve a change in orientation of the object but not in the same manner as the training transformation. In (A), the funnel has been rotated so that what was the top is now facing the viewer. In (B), the object is rotated so that it is upside down from its initial position.

Transformation (C) is the correct one because it most closely follows the pattern of the training transformation. The top part of the sink is still attached, and the object has been rotated similarly to the training transformation. Additionally, there isn't any other alteration in size, number, or color of the object.",0,No change
49,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

Original observation: The training transformation involves a ship on the left. The ship is upright and intact. To the right of the ship, we see a rotated and separated version of the ship with parts of it disassembled and clearly visible on different planes, facing downward. 

Based on this transformation, let's analyze the options:

- (A) The object on the left appears to be a white bathroom sink with a faucet on a base. It transforms into a sink that is rotated 90 degrees to the side (the faucet is now on the top) but remains unchanged in number, color, or separation into parts.
- (B) This shows the same object as (A) but without any transformation. The sink on the left and the sink on the right are identical, with no change in orientation, number, color, or disassembly.
- (C) Again, it's the white bathroom sink with a faucet on a base. In this transformation, the right image shows the sink rotated almost 90 degrees toward the viewer, and the base is separated from the sink just like the parts of the ship are separated in the training transformation.

Option (C) is the correct answer because it has the same kind of transformation as observed in the training set - an object that has been rotated and had parts separated, which matches the disassembly and rotation seen in the ship example.",1,2DRotation+90
49,2,0,+90,0,90,180,0,"The correct transformation following the training transformation is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we observe a ship rotate approximately 90 degrees to the right about an axis running from the front to the back of the ship, such that the previously visible side now faces downwards and the top becomes visible.

2. Transformation (A) shows a satellite dish that has been rotated in a way that the dish part is now facing away from the viewer, with the orientation of the support pillar remaining unchanged. This represents a horizontal or pancake flip rather than a rotation about an axis running through the object.

3. Transformation (B) shows no change; the before and after images of the object are the same, indicating no transformation has occurred.

4. Transformation (C) shows that the satellite dish has been rotated approximately 90 degrees to the right around an axis running through the center of the dish support pillar, similar to the training transformation. The orientation of the dish's surface has changed from facing us to facing the right, much like the ship's visible side changed orientation in the training transformation.

Therefore, option (C) is the one that correctly follows the training transformation.",0,2DRotation180
