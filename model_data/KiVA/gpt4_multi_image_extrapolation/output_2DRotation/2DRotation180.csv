Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows a dog on the left that is upright. On the right, the same dog is shown upside down which indicates a rotational transformation along the horizontal axis.

3. Option (B) shows the object (a submarine or similar) on the left presented with its top side facing up. On the right, the same object is presented with its bottom side facing up, which indicates that it has been rotated along the horizontal axis, similar to the rotation seen in the training transformation.

4. Option (C) shows the object (a submarine or similar) on the left moving to the right which remains unchanged in terms of size, orientation, number, or color. It is just translated to the right without any other transformation.

1. In the training transformation, we observe a dog object that changes its orientation from an upright standing position to an upside down position. The size, color, and number of the dogs remain unchanged, and the dog is rotated around its horizontal axis.

2. Now let's inspect each transformation option:

   - (C) shows a zeppelin-shaped object with no change in orientation or any other characteristic.

3. Only (B) matches the training transformation, where the object rotates around its horizontal axis to change its orientation from upright to upside down. The other options either have a different type of rotation as in (A) or no change at all as in (C).",0,2DRotation+90

1. The training transformation shows a three-dimensional figure of a dog that rotates from an upright standing position on the left to an upside-down position on the right. The object retains its color, size, and overall shape during this rotation.

2. Transformation (A) shows the same object in both pictures, with no apparent changes in size, orientation, color, or number of objects.

3. Transformation (B) shows the object moving from left to right with a change in its orientation from forward-facing to rear-facing. The size, color, and the number of objects remain unchanged.

4. Transformation (C) shows the object changing its orientation from a side view to a bottom-up view, while the color, size, and number remain unchanged. This most closely resembles the training transformation, where the dog is also rotated to show a different view (from standing to upside-down) without changing its other properties.

3. In transformation (B), the fries and the container appear to flip upside down. This is also not the same transformation as observed in the training image.

4. In transformation (C), the fries and the container maintain their upright orientation, and the transformation simply seems to be a rotation around the central vertical axis, which is consistent with the transformation observed in the training image.

   - In transformation (A), the object remains unchanged; there is no rotation or change in position.
   - In transformation (B), the object has rotated, changing its orientation from an upright position to being on its side, similar to the training transformation.
   - In transformation (C), while the object has rotated and changed orientation, the rotation here is around a horizontal axis, resulting in the 'fries' changing from an upright position to a downward-dropping position, which does not match the axis of rotation seen in the training transformation.

Training transformation:
- The object (a three-dimensional structure with a circular element and two rectangular extensions) rotates approximately 90 degrees on an axis running through the circular element perpendicular to the rectangular extensions.
- No changes in size, color, or number of objects are evident.

Option (A):
- The fries are rotated and seem to fall out from the carton.
- This involves a change in orientation and also a change in the arrangement/configuration of the fries within the carton.

Option (B):
- The fries and carton appear identical in both the left and right images.
- There is no visible transformation.

Option (C):
- The carton with the fries rotates approximately 90 degrees on a horizontal axis (if considering the initial fries position as upright).
- The fries maintain their arrangement/configuration within the carton.

The transformation in option (C) is most consistent with the training transformation because it involves a similar rotation without altering other aspects such as size, color, or number of elements - just as in the training transformation, the object is rotated while all other attributes remain constant.

Step-by-step reasoning for the choice:

- The training transformation shows a rocking horse that has been flipped over from an upright position to a position where it is upside down. The crucial aspect of this transformation is the change in orientation, with the horse maintaining the same size, color, and number of visible elements.

- For option (A), the object (which appears to be a toy with a penguin motif) is rotated, but the orientation concerning the 'ground' plane or perspective of the observer remains the same. Therefore, it doesn't match the training transformation where the orientation shift involves a flip to an upside-down position.

- For option (B), the object undergoes a similar transformation as the training example. It is flipped over in such a way that the top becomes the bottom, matching the upside-down change in orientation seen in the training transformation.

- For option (C), the object is also rotated, but, as with (A), it remains in the same upright orientation relative to the observer. It does not get flipped over to an inverted position.

2. Option (A) Analysis: The left image shows a penguin toy oriented with the head at the top. The right image presents the same penguin toy rotated, with the head now on the right side. This transformation shows a change in orientation while maintaining the same size, color, and number of objects.

1. Looking at the training transformation, we can see that the object is rotated and slightly repositioned, but there are no changes in size, color, or number of components. The training transformation primarily involves rotation and repositioning.

2. Transformation (A) shows an object that has flipped upside down (rotated 180 degrees vertically) from left to right. This is a change in orientation but not identical to the training transformation, which involves a rotation without flipping the object over completely.

3. Transformation (B) shows the object having been rotated slightly clockwise, much like the rotation seen in the training transformation. The size, color, and number of components remain unchanged, which is consistent with the training example.

4. Transformation (C) shows an object that has been not only rotated but also changed in shape; an addition of a triangular fin-like component is present in the right image. This does not follow the training transformation, as there is a change in the object components' number and configuration, beyond simple rotation and repositioning.

- (B) shows a bunch of grapes with a certain leaf orientation on the left, and on the right, the same bunch of grapes appears with the leaves seemingly in the same position as before. There's no apparent rotation or orientation change.

- (C) shows a bunch of grapes with a certain leaf orientation on the left, but on the right, the bunch of grapes appears to mirror the orientation of the leaves, suggesting that the bunch has been flipped vertically, which is analogous to the upside-down orientation change seen in the training transformation.

Given the comparisons, it is (C) that follows the training transformation, as it involves a vertical flip, changing the orientation of the object from the original position to an upside-down position, just like the training transformation.",0,No change

1. The training transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object. The object on the left is a grey structure with a central axis perpendicular to the ground and additional parts symmetrically arranged, while the object on the right has been rotated such that the central axis is now parallel to the ground. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects; the change is strictly in the orientation.

2. Option (A) shows grape clusters with a stem and leaves. The transformation involves rotating the grape cluster so that the stem and leaves go from pointing upwards to pointing rightward. This maintains the number, size, and color of the grapes, while only the orientation is altered.

3. Option (B) also shows a grape cluster, but the transformation here involves a rotation that positions the stem and leaves downward to pointing leftward. This change is not just in orientation since the grape cluster is also flipped horizontally, which is a change beyond a simple rotation.

4. Option (C) is similar to option (B) with the stem and leaves pointed in a different direction (down and to the right) after a horizontal flip and slight rotation.

3. The object's color does not change; there are no color differences between the left and right images.

2. Transformation (A): The cat-like figure on the left has been flipped over horizontally and slightly rotated to achieve the orientation of the figure on the right. This is not solely a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

3. Transformation (B): The figure on the left appears to be unchanged in its orientation in the figure on the right. There is no transformation of the orientation at all.

4. Transformation (C): The cat-like figure on the left has been rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise to achieve the orientation of the figure on the right. This matches the rotation seen in the training transformation.

Now, let's go through the step-by-step reasoning:

The training transformation shows a coffee cup that is rotated about 90 degrees. The object retains its color, size, and the number of objects remains the same. There are no additional or missing elements after the transformation.

Let's examine the three provided transformations:

- Transformation (A) involves a change from an upright cat figure to a cat figure on its back, which includes a change in orientation similar to the training transformation. However, unlike the training transformation, the cat figure in (A) also changes in color, going from colored to a monochrome or grayscale palette. This additional change disqualifies option (A) from matching the training transformation since the training transformation did not include a change in color.
  
- Transformation (B) shows the same cat figure with no changes at all, meaning there is no transformation taking place. This option does not match the training transformation, which involved rotating the object.

- Transformation (C) shows the cat figure being rotated approximately 90 degrees and also changing orientation from facing forward to being upside down. Although there is a rotation involved, the rotation leads to a different orientation than the training transformation (upside down vs. sideways), and the color change to monochrome occurs as well, which is not present in the training transformation.

Since none of the provided transformations (A), (B), or (C) match the training transformation exactly by only involving a rotation without any other changes, the",0,Doesn't apply

Step 1: Identify the training transformation between the first pair of images (the original transformation to be matched). The object in the first image seems to rotate about a horizontal axis to become the object in the second image. The object appears to be a stylized model of a handgun, and it has gone from an upright position to lying on its side after the transformation.

Step 2: Compare the training transformation with the transformations (A), (B), and (C).

- (A) shows an airplane that has rotated along its longitudinal axis. The direction of rotation is perpendicular to the direction of the training transformation.
- (B) indicates a vertical rotation that is similar to flipping the airplane upside down about its longitudinal axis, which is not the same as the horizontal rotation observed in the training transformation.
- (C) depicts an airplane that appears to rotate about a horizontal axis, just like the training transformation. The plane starts upright and then lies on its side.

Step 3: Conclude that (C) follows the training transformation because it is the only transformation where the airplane rotates about a horizontal axis, and it results in the plane positioning from upright to lying on its side, akin to the transformation observed with the stylized handgun.",0,No change

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The training transformation shows an object (a handgun) changing orientation from left-to-right and also changing in complexity—from a simpler to a more complex form. There's also a slight change in proportion or size of some parts of the object.

Now let's analyze the options (A), (B), and (C) based on the criteria identified in the training transformation (change in orientation, complexity, and size/proportion):

(A) - The airplane changes orientation from facing left to facing downward-right. There's also a change in complexity, as it appears that details are added in the right image (e.g., a more intricate engine design and shaded cockpit windows). This follows the transformation criteria noted in the training example.

(B) - The orientation change is similar to (A), but there is no observable complexity increase or significant change in proportion or size of the parts. This does not fully follow the transformation observed in the training example.

(C) - There is no visible change in orientation, complexity, or proportion. This fails to follow the transformation observed in the training example.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Training transformation: The picture on the left shows a brown object that looks like a pistol, and the picture on the right shows the same object with the orientation changed. Specifically, the object is rotated so that the top part is now at the bottom, and the bottom part at the top.

2. Transformation (A): The left picture shows a red plane with its left wing pointing upwards, and the right picture shows the same plane with the left wing still pointing upwards. There is no change in the orientation of any part of the plane, thus this transformation does not match the training transformation.

3. Transformation (B): Like (A), the left picture shows a red plane with its left wing pointing upwards, and the right picture shows the same plane with the left wing still pointing upwards. There is no orientation change in this transformation either, so it does not match the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C): The left picture shows a red plane with its left wing pointing upwards, and the right picture shows the same plane but with the wing that was pointing upwards now pointing downwards, much like how the top part of the object in the training transformation is now at the bottom.

1. In the training transformation, the object, a green hat, undergoes a change in orientation. The hat on the left is oriented with the top facing up, and the hat on the right is oriented with the bottom facing up (it has been flipped vertically).

2. Option (A) shows a piece of furniture with shelves. From the left image to the right, the furniture appears to be opened up or unfolded. This does not match the training transformation because it represents a change in structure or configuration rather than a simple flip or rotation.

3. Option (B) shows the same piece of furniture, and its transformation also does not involve a simple flip or rotation. Instead, it shows the furniture slightly closed up compared to the left image, indicating a structural change rather than a rotation or flip as in the training example.

4. Option (C) shows the furniture with a change in orientation similar to the training transformation. The furniture on the left has one part vertically oriented, and on the right image, the furniture has been rotated in a way that none of the parts maintain the same orientation as before, creating an illusion of viewing it from a different angle altogether.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Training Transformation: The transformation involves rotating the object, a green hat in this case, from a right-side-up position to an upside-down position, with no other changes in size, number, or color.

3. Transformation (B): This shows the piece of furniture rotated in a similar manner as the hat in the training transformation, from an upright position to an upside-down position, with no other changes in size, number, or color.

4. Transformation (C): The furniture is rotated and also repositioned with the compartments arranged differently, which is not in line with the training transformation that included only rotation.

Here is the step-by-step analysis of the transformations:

Training Transformation:
The green hat on the left appears initially to be viewed from the top, while the green hat on the right appears to be viewed from below. The transformation involves a change in the object's orientation.

(A) The transformation shows a piece of furniture with open compartments. It has rotated such that the open compartments face upwards in the right image instead of outwards as in the left image. This is an orientation change similar to the training transformation.

(B) The piece of furniture with open compartments appears to rotate in a way it had rotated in (A), resulting in an orientation change. But the compartments on the right image seem to be viewed from a different angle or perspective compared to (A), indicating that not just rotation is involved but also a viewpoint change.

(C) The piece of furniture in this transformation remains static in terms of orientation. There is no change in angle, perspective, or any other property visible; rather, it is the same orientation in both the left and right images.

The only transformation that follows the training transformation is (A), which involves an orientation change. However, after a closer analysis, I have to correct myself: none of the transformations precisely match the training example's type of orientation change. While (A) initially appears to be the closest match due to an orientation change, the object in the training transformation seems to undergo a specific type of orientation change where the perspective shifts from top to bottom.",0,Doesn't apply

1. The training transformation image shows a handheld device that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise from its original position. The size, number, and color of the object have remained unchanged; only the orientation has been altered.

2. Transformation (A) shows a cake that has been similarly rotated 90 degrees clockwise from its original position. The size, number, and color of the cake remain the same between the two images, demonstrating a change solely in orientation.

3. Transformation (B) does not follow the training transformation because the two images show the same orientation of the cake. There is no change in position, size, color, or number, thus it does not match the training transformation.

4. Transformation (C) does not follow the training transformation because the cake appears to have been rotated but not in the same manner as the training transformation. It appears to be rotated less than 90 degrees, making the transformation inconsistent with the training transformation.

Therefore, option (A) is the correct transformation that follows the training transformation, as it shows a consistent change in orientation, aligning with the parameters set by the original transformation of the handheld device.",1,2DRotation180

- Transformed Position (Right): The same walkie-talkie is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, with the antenna pointing to the right.
- What Changed: The orientation of the object is changed; it is turned 90 degrees clockwise.

- Transformed Position (Right): The same cake appears unchanged in orientation or any other visible aspect.
- What Changed: There is no visible change in orientation, size, number, or color between the two images.

Option (B):
- Original Position (Left): A cake in an upright position.
- Transformed Position (Right): The cake is upside down, the text is reversed, and the orientation is altered.
- What Changed: The orientation of the cake is changed; it seems to be rotated approximately 180 degrees, and the camera perspective is flipped.
- Result: Follows the training transformation in terms of an orientation change; however, the angle of rotation is different (180 degrees instead of 90 degrees).

Option (C):
- Original Position (Left): A cake in an upright position.

2. Option (A) shows a similar transformation. The character in the first image is upright, and in the transformed image, the character is upside down. Therefore, option (A) follows the same type of transformation observed in the training transformation.

1. Training Transformation Analysis: The training transformation shows a plane that changes orientation and partially its shape. The plane goes from horizontal orientation to vertical, and from an airplane shape to a shape resembling a fish (nose of the plane becomes the fish's head, the wings become fins, and the tail becomes the fish's tail).

2. Image (A): It shows a shoe that changes orientation and partially its shape. The shoe goes from an upright position to a side position, and the shape changes to appear more like a heel due to the change in perspective.

3. Image (B): It shows a shoe that also changes orientation and becomes a heel in perspective, similar to (A), but it is angled slightly differently compared to image (A).

4. Image (C): This image shows two shoes in an identical position, with no change in orientation or shape transformation.

The correct transformation that follows the training transformation is (A) because it shows a change in both orientation and a partial transformation of shape that, due to perspective, gives a different appearance of the object. This is the closest to what occurs in the training transformation, where the path of change involves orientation and an altered perspective suggesting the object has become something else.",1,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The training transformation shows an elephant transforming such that the image on the right is a rotated and horizontally flipped version of the one on the left. There is no change in color or size, and the number of elephants remains one.

2. Examining transformation (A): The object on the right is rotated compared to the object on the left. However, this transformation includes a vertical flip (upside down). The training transformation involved a horizontal flip, not a vertical flip. Therefore, this does not match the training transformation.

3. Examining transformation (B): The object on the right is also rotated. This transformation includes vertical rotation (the object is upside down), not a horizontal flip. Thus, this transformation also does not match the training transformation.

4. Examining transformation (C): The object on the right is rotated and horizontally flipped compared to the object on the left, which matches the type of transformation seen in the training transformation. There is no change in color, size, or number of objects.

The training transformation presents an elephant object that flips upside down and also changes orientation to face the opposite direction.

Looking at transformations (A), (B), and (C), here is the step-by-step reasoning:

(A) shows an object (a scooter with two riders) that rotates to its right side. This transformation involves a change in orientation, but the object does not flip upside down; instead, it simply lies on its side.

(B) shows the same object that rotates slightly to its right side, ending in a similar position as in transformation (A), with again a change in orientation but not flipping upside down.

(C) shows the object flipping upside down, as evidenced by the wheels which initially point downwards and then point upwards in the destination image. Additionally, the head of the character wearing a yellow top faces to the right side in the initial image and faces to the left in the destination image, indicating a change in orientation to face the opposite direction.

Therefore, transformation (C) correctly follows the training transformation. It presents the same type of changes: the object flips upside down and changes its orientation to face the opposite direction.",1,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see an elephant object that is rotated such that it appears upside down in the right image. The color, size and number of elephants remain the same.

2. Looking at option (A), the scooter and riders are rotated slightly to the right from the original orientation. However, this is not a full upside-down rotation and no other changes are observed, so this does not match the training transformation.

3. Option (B) shows a scooter and riders from an overhead perspective in the first image, and a bottom-up perspective in the second image (as if the scooter were flipped over), maintaining the same color, size, and number of riders. This matches the training transformation where the elephant is flipped to an upside-down position without altering the other attributes.

4. Option (C) also shows a similar rotation to (A), with the scooter and riders being rotated slightly to the left. Again, it's not an upside-down transformation.

Thus, the transformation seen in option (B) most closely follows the pattern of the training transformation by preserving the other attributes and applying an upside-down rotation.",1,2DRotation180

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial image shows a figure (which I will not identify) in an upright position and the transformed image shows the same figure upside down and split in half, but with the halves connected. There is no change in size, color, or number, but there is a change in orientation and structure.

2. Now, looking at the three provided transformations (A), (B), and (C):
- Transformation (A) shows a snake with no change in orientation, size, color, or number; therefore, it does not match the training transformation.
- Transformation (B) shows a snake that has been twisted such that the creature's head and tail are now on the same side, while the body loop has been rotated. This represents a change in orientation and structure, without changes in size, color, or number. This most closely matches the training transformation in that it involves a change in orientation and structure without changing other properties.
- Transformation (C) shows a snake that appears to be split into two separate snakes, which introduces a change in number. Since the training transformation did not include a change in number, this transformation does not match the training either.

Therefore, the answer is (B) because it captures the type of transformation (change in orientation and structure) seen in the training example without introducing changes in other properties.",0,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, the character depicted goes from an upright position to being upside down. There's no change in color, number, or size—it's purely a change in orientation.

    - (A) shows a snake that goes from a coiled position to a more elongated position. This change does not match the training transformation because there is no inversion of orientation.
    
    - (B) shows a snake in the same coiled position before and after, with no changes in orientation, size, color, or number.
    
    - (C) shows a snake that transforms from a coiled position to an upside-down coiled position. This matches the training transformation because the only change that occurs is an inversion of orientation, just like the character.

(A) - The object (snake) is the same in both pictures with no transformation applied.
(B) - The object is duplicated and mirrored horizontally.

2. Observe each option in turn:
   - (A) displays a guitar that changes in both color and orientation. This does not match the training transformation, which only had a change in orientation.
   - (B) shows a guitar that changes in orientation by rotating and also flips upside down. This is similar to the training transformation but the flip is an additional change that was not present in the training transformation.
   - (C) has a guitar that changes orientation by rotating but does not change in color, size, or number. This matches the training transformation, which also involved a change in orientation without altering other characteristics.

(B) shows a guitar that changes orientation from upright to laying flat, with no change in size, color, or number.
(C) shows a guitar that remains upright and changes in color, with no change in orientation, size, or number.

3. In (B), the frog on the right has changed its orientation; it appears to be flipped over onto its back relative to the left frog. This is also not the same as the training transformation since no opening or unfolding is involved.

4. In (C), the frog on the right shows a transformation that resembles 'opening' or 'unfolding' of the left leg, which is now significantly raised compared to the left image. This is similar to the action observed in the training transformation where the object has been opened along a seam.

(B) shows an object that has again been flipped, but this time over a vertical axis, which is the same axis as the training transformation, but it results in a mirror image, not a rotation that preserves the orientation of the original features like the training transformation.

(C) shows the object being rotated slightly clockwise; however, this rotation is more similar to a 2D plane rotation or tilt rather than a 3D rotation around a vertical axis as in the training transformation.

1. Looking at the training transformation, we note that the object (a toy) has undergone a rotation. Specifically, it appears to have been flipped around the axis running from the head to the base, resulting in an upside-down position.

2. Now, we compare this transformation to the given options (A), (B), and (C).

   - (A) shows a giraffe that has been flipped over back to front, which involves rotation but around a different axis than what we see in the training transformation.
   - (B) shows two giraffes that are the same, with no evident transformation.
   - (C) shows a giraffe that has been rotated around an axis running from the head to the legs, resulting in an upside-down position, similar to the training transformation.

3. Since the transformation in (C) closely matches the type of rotation seen in the training transformation, where the object is flipped upside down along a head-to-base axis, the correct answer is (C).",0,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the provided training transformation, we see a kayak with paddles. The transformation involves a rotation of the object around its center. The kayak on the right is rotated counter-clockwise to be at an angle compared to the kayak on the left, which is oriented straight horizontally.

- Option (A) shows a guitar on the left, which is also transformed by a rotation. The guitar on the right is rotated counter-clockwise to be at an angle, similar to the kayak's transformation in the training example.

- Option (B) does not show any transformation. The guitar on the left and the guitar on the right are identical, with no change in size, orientation, number, or color.

- Option (C) also shows a rotation of the guitar. However, the rotation is clockwise and not counterclockwise as in the training example. The guitar on the right is rotated to the right relative to its initial position, which does not match the direction of the training transformation.

2. Looking at transformation (A), we see that the guitar remains unchanged between the two images; there is no rotation or other obvious transformation.

3. Transformation (B) shows the guitar being rotated around its vertical axis similarly to the kayak. The guitar remains the same size, color, and a single object is present in both images.

(B) In option (B), the fox rotates and also changes its position from standing to lying down. This introduces an additional change beyond the rotation seen in the training transformation.
(C) In option (C), the transformation is more complex as the fox appears to be jumping and rotating, changing its original standing pose entirely. There's also a different perspective on the fox in the second image compared to the first, indicating a change in orientation and also in apparent size due to the perspective shift.

1. In the training transformation, we see a caterpillar. From the left image to the right image, the object undergoes a change in orientation.

- (B) shows a sandwich that stays the same in orientation, color, size, and number, just like (A).
- (C) also shows a sandwich that stays the same in orientation, color, size, and number.

3. Since none of the options (A), (B), or (C) show a change in orientation and all the properties such as color, size, and number remain unchanged, none of these options reflect the kind of transformation seen in the training example.

2. Now, we move on to analyze each of the given transformations (A), (B), and (C).

Let's analyze the training transformation first:
1. The object's orientation changes – it appears to be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise around a vertical axis when viewed from the front.

Now, let's analyze each of the options (A), (B), and (C) to see if they follow the same transformation:

(A) The object is rotated, but it looks like it has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. This is not the same transformation as the training transformation.

(B) Similarly, the object has been rotated approximately 90 degrees, but again in the clockwise direction, not counter-clockwise like in the training transformation.

(C) In this transformation, the object does not seem to have been rotated at all. The perspective seems to change slightly, implying a tilt rather than a rotation, so this does not match the transformation observed in the training set.

4. Option (C): The plant on the left is shorter, and on the right, it appears stretched or elongated without changing in the number of flowers, their orientation, or their color. This transformation shows an increase in size or stretching, which is similar to the training transformation.

   - For (A), the bunch of flowers rotates clockwise and increases in size from left to right.
   - For (B), there is no change in size or orientation of the flower bunch from left to right.
   - For (C), the flower bunch rotates clockwise, similar to (A), but does not change in size.

3. Option (A) is the correct match with the training transformation, as it is the only one among the three where the object (the flower bunch) both changes in size and rotates from left to right, matching the pattern shown in the training transformation with the croissant. The only difference is the direction of rotation (in the training transformation, the object rotates slightly counter-clockwise, whereas in (A), the object rotates clockwise), but since the primary attributes of size increase and rotation are present, (A) is the best match.

- Training Transformation: We notice that the brown bookshelf on the left is opening towards the right side, rotating along a vertical axis situated on the left edge of the bookshelf. On the right, the same bookshelf is shown at an advanced stage of this rightward opening or rotation.
- Image (A): Shows a teddy bear oriented normally on the left, and flipped upside down on the right (rotation along a horizontal axis at teddy bear's midsection). This is not the same transformation observed in the training image as there is no lateral opening or rotation.
- Image (B): Shows the teddy bear twice, both times oriented in the same direction and position, with no apparent change at all. This does not match the training transformation either.
- Image (C): The left image shows the teddy bear with its front facing the viewer, while the right image shows the bear rotated to the viewer's left side (rotating along a vertical axis), much like the bookshelf is opened to one side in the training transformation.

Thus, transformation (C) is the one that follows the training transformation pattern of a rotation along a vertical axis on one side of the object, displaying a lateral opening or ""unfolding"" motion.",0,2DRotation+90
47,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(D)

The transformation in the training example involves a rotation of the object. The object, an open bookshelf, rotates from facing left to facing right without any other changes in size, color, or number of components.

Now let's examine each of the given transformations:

(A) This shows a plush toy teddy bear. In the transformation from left to right, the teddy bear is flipped upside down. This is a type of rotation but not the same as the training example. The training example rotates the object along the vertical axis, while this transformation flips it along the horizontal axis.

(B) Similar to (A), the teddy bear is flipped, but in a slightly different manner. Again, this is not a rotation along the vertical axis like in the training example.

(C) This image shows the teddy bear remained in the same orientation from the left image to the right image. There is no visible transformation taking place.

Since none of the options (A), (B), or (C) demonstrate the same kind of rotational transformation along the vertical axis as seen in the training example, the correct answer is (D), as none of the options apply.",0,Doesn't apply
47,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(C)

Let's analyze the training transformation first and then apply the same reasoning to the options given:

Training Transformation:
- Left image: A closed brown shelf attached to a wall.
- Right image: The same shelf but in an open position, rotated around the vertical axis of the hinges that attach it to the wall.
- The transformation involves a change in orientation around a vertical axis without any changes to color, size, or number of objects.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) Transformation:
- Left image: A teddy bear sitting upright.
- Right image: The same teddy bear but lying on its back.
- The transformation involves a change in orientation, but it appears to be a rotation around the bear's horizontal axis, not the vertical one as in the training transformation.

(B) Transformation:
- Left image: A teddy bear sitting upright.
- Right image: The same teddy bear but turned to its side.
- The transformation does involve a change in orientation, but this time it's a rotation around a different axis, which seems to be horizontal and passing through the bear's sides instead of the vertical one as in the training transformation.

(C) Transformation:
- Left image: A teddy bear sitting upright.
- Right image: The same teddy bear but slightly rotated around a vertical axis.
- This transformation closely matches the training transformation because the teddy bear rotates around a vertical axis resembling the way the shelf opened, without any changes to color, size,",0,No change
48,0,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning for choice (B):

1. In the training transformation, the submarine on the left is horizontally flipped to get the submarine on the right. The orientation changes from facing left to facing right.
2. Now, looking at the options provided:
   - (A): Shows the same fish with no changes to size, orientation, number, or color. This does not follow the training transformation.
   - (B): Shows a fish that has been horizontally flipped from facing left to facing right, which exactly matches the change in orientation of the training transformation.
   - (C): Shows the same fish with no changes to size, orientation, number, or color. This does not follow the training transformation.

Option (B) is the only one that follows the specific transformation seen in the training example, which is the horizontal flip altering the object's orientation.",0,2DRotation+90
48,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct transformation following the training transformation is (B).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for my choice:

1. The training transformation shows a change in orientation—where the object (a submarine) rotates about a vertical axis to face the opposite direction while maintaining the same size, color, and number of objects.

2. Option (A) shows a change in both orientation (the fish is flipped around a vertical axis) and color (the colors are swapped between blue and yellow). This is not consistent with the training transformation, which only has a change in orientation.

3. Option (B) shows a change in orientation only, where the fish rotates about a vertical axis to face the opposite direction without any other changes. This matches the transformation seen in the training example.

4. Option (C) shows a change in orientation (the fish is flipped around a horizontal axis) and a slight change in the position relative to the axis, with the fish appearing slightly lower in the frame on the right side. This is different from the simple orientation change in the training transformation.

Therefore, only option (B) follows the training transformation, which involves a change in orientation without altering size, color, or number of objects.",0,No change
48,2,0,180,0,180,90,0,"(C)

Let's analyze the training transformation step by step:

1. The object maintains its color.
2. The object's orientation changes from horizontal to vertical.
3. The object's shape remains constant aside from the change in orientation.
4. There is no change in the number of objects.

Now let’s examine the given transformations (A), (B), and (C) with the same criteria:

(A) The object (fish) changes orientation from horizontal to vertical and maintains its color, which matches the criteria from the training transformation. However, the fish also changes its position (it is mirrored along a vertical axis), which is an additional transformation not present in the training example.

(B) The object (fish) maintains its orientation and does not match the training transformation, which involves a change in orientation.

(C) The object (fish) changes its orientation from horizontal to vertical, maintains its color, and there is no additional transformation. It follows the exact transformation seen in the training example.

Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because it is the only transformation that matches all criteria of the training transformation.",0,2DRotation+90

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the training transformation, we see a ship on the left and the same ship rotated almost 90 degrees to the right on the right image. This transformation involves a change in orientation of the object.

2. Now, let's examine the three given transformations:
   - In transformation (A), the object on the left is rotated slightly to the object on the right. However, the rotation here is not nearly as much as in the training transformation.
   - In transformation (B), the object on the left is identical to the one on the right, indicating no change occurred at all.
   - In transformation (C), the object on the left is rotated significantly, close to 90 degrees, to become the object on the right. This resembles the type of transformation seen in the training example.

3. Since we are looking for a transformation that involves a major change in orientation, similar to the training example, the correct answer is transformation (C), which shows a similar rotation to the training transformation. However, there is no option (C) here as a choice because of an oversight in the answer choices, so the only viable option closest to (C) is (B) as it is the only one remaining that involves any change in orientation, even though it's minimal.

Please note that if there was an option (C), that would be the correct choice as it exactly follows the training transformation. However, by process of elimination and the available",0,No change
49,1,0,180,0,180,90,0,"The correct transformation is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

Training transformation: Observing the transformation of the object from left to right in the training image, we notice that the object (a ship) has been rotated about the front-to-back axis, leading to the top of the ship facing downwards in the right image.

Now let's analyze the three transformation options provided:

(A) This image shows a basin that seems to face the same direction in both the left and right images. There is no apparent change in orientation, size, number, or color. Thus, this does not match the training transformation that involved a rotational change.

(B) This image shows a basin that, like the transformation in the training transformation, has been rotated around the axis running from the front to the back of the basin. Thus, the transformation is similar to the one in the training image.

(C) This image shows a basin that has been rotated, but not in the same manner as the training transformation. Instead, the rotation here seems to be around the axis that runs from left to right—or from one side of the basin to the other. This is not the same axis of rotation as the training transformation.

Based on the rotational change, (B) is the option that follows the training transformation.",0,2DRotation+90
49,2,0,180,0,180,+90,0,"(C)

To determine which transformation follows the training transformation, we need to analyze what changes occur between the images in the training transformation and then compare them to the provided options (A), (B), and (C).

Training Transformation:
- The ship on the left is shown in an upright orientation.
- The ship on the right is turned upside down, with its base facing upwards.

Now let's analyze the given options:

(A) Shows a satellite dish that is turned slightly to the side in the second image.
(B) Shows no change in the orientation, size, number, or color between the two images of the satellite dish.
(C) Shows a satellite dish that starts in an upright position and is then turned upside down in the second image, similar to the transformation of the ship.

Since the transformation shown in (C) mirrors that of the training transformation where the object is turned upside down, (C) is the correct answer.",0,2DRotation+90
