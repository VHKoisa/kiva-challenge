Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Count the objects (which appear to be some kind of toy or figure with a blue base and red top) in the picture on the left. There are 3 objects.
2. Count the objects in the picture on the right. There is 1 object.
3. Calculate the change in the number of objects from the left to the right picture: 3 objects (left) - 1 object (right) = 2 objects fewer on the right.
4. The transformation from the left to the right picture shows a decrease in the number of objects by 2.
5. Among the options given, rule (1) states ""Things go down by 2,"" which correctly describes the transformation observed.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the training transformation is (1).",0,Things go down by 2

To determine the transformation rule from left to right, let's count the number of objects in each picture.

- On the left side, there are 3 objects.
- On the right side, there is 1 object.

From this, we can see that the number of objects decreases from the left picture to the right picture. Calculating the difference:

3 objects (left) - 1 object (right) = 2 objects fewer

Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is:

(1) Things go down by 2",0,Things go down by 2
28,2,3,5,"(1)

To determine the transformation rule, let's examine the two images:

- The left image has three objects.
- The right image has one object.

Now let's go through the rules one by one:

(1) Things go down by 2:
If we subtract two objects from the three objects in the left image, we are left with one object, which matches the right image.

(2) Things go up by 2:
This can't be correct because the number of objects in the right image is less than the number of objects in the left image.

(3) No change between pictures:
This rule is not applicable as there is a change in the number of objects from the left to the right image.

(4) Doesn't apply:
Since we can observe a clear change, this option is also not relevant.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation from the left image to the right image is that ""Things go down by 2"".",0,Things go down by 2

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Count the number of objects (squirrels) in the image on the left: there are 5 squirrels.
2. Count the number of objects (squirrels) in the image on the right: there are 3 squirrels.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of squirrels in the two images: 5 - 3 = 2.
4. Since there are 2 fewer squirrels in the image on the right, the transformation involves a reduction of 2 objects from left to right.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that ""things go down by 2.""",0,Things go down by 2
18,1,4,6,"(2)

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation from the left picture to the right picture, we need to count the number of objects (in this case, squirrels) in each picture.

1. Count the squirrels in the left picture: there are seven squirrels.
2. Count the squirrels in the right picture: there are five squirrels.
3. Determine the change in the number of squirrels: five squirrels on the right minus seven squirrels on the left equals a reduction of two.

Since the number of objects goes down by 2 from the left picture to the right, rule number 2, ""Things go down by 2,"" is the correct answer.",0,Things go down by 2
18,2,4,6,"(1)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Count the number of objects (squirrels) in the left picture: There are 5 squirrels.

2. Count the number of objects in the right picture: There are 3 squirrels.

3. Determine the change in the number of squirrels: 5 squirrels - 3 squirrels = 2 squirrels.

4. Analyze the change: The number of squirrels has decreased by 2.

Based on this analysis, the best rule that describes the transformation from left to right is that ""Things go down by 2"".",0,Things go down by 2

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Count the number of objects in the picture on the left: there are three objects (rocks).
2. Count the number of objects in the picture on the right: there are five objects (rocks).
3. Compare the counts: the picture on the right has two more objects than the picture on the left.
4. Conclude the transformation rule: the number of objects increases by two from the left picture to the right picture.",1,Things go up by 2
10,1,2,4,"(1)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the number of objects (rocks) in the picture on the left: there are three rocks.

2. Observe the number of objects in the picture on the right: there are five rocks.

3. Count the change in the number of objects from left to right: the number increases by two (from three to five).

4. Match this observation with the given rules: The rule that things go up by 2 is the correct rule to describe this transformation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that things go up by 2.",1,Things go up by 2
10,2,2,4,"(3)

The left picture features three rocks, and as we move to the picture on the right, we still observe three rocks. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Count the number of rocks in the left picture: there are three rocks.
2. Count the number of rocks in the right picture: there are also three rocks.
3. Compare the two numbers: since both pictures have the same number of rocks, there has been no increase or decrease in quantity.
4. Determine which rule applies: since there is no change in the number of rocks from the left picture to the right picture, the rule that best describes this transformation is rule (3), which indicates that there is ""No change between pictures.""",0,No change between pictures

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. First, count the number of objects (which are small houses) in the picture on the left. There are two houses shown.

2. Then count the number of objects (houses) in the picture on the right. There are four houses shown.

3. Calculate the difference in the number of objects from the left picture to the right picture. The right picture has four houses, and the left picture has two houses, so the difference is 4 - 2 = 2.

4. Since there is an increase of two houses from the left picture to the right picture, this transformation aligns with rule number one, where ""Things go up by 2."" 

Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation from the left picture to the right picture is (1) Things go up by 2.",1,Things go up by 2
20,1,2,4,"(1)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Count the number of objects (which are houses) on the left side of the transformation. There are 2 houses in the picture on the left.
2. Count the number of objects (houses) on the right side of the transformation. There are 4 houses in the picture on the right.
3. Determine the difference in the number of houses between the two pictures. The picture on the right has 2 more houses than the picture on the left (4 - 2 = 2).
4. The transformation rule that describes this increase is ""Things go up by 2,"" which means that the correct rule number is (1).",1,Things go up by 2

To determine the rule that describes the left-to-right transformation, let's analyze the images step by step:

1. Count the number of objects in the left image: There are three objects (presumably houses).
2. Count the number of objects in the right image: There are five objects (presumably houses).
3. Determine the difference in the number of objects: The right image has two more objects than the left image.
4. Match the change to the corresponding rule: The rule that things go up by 2 applies here.
