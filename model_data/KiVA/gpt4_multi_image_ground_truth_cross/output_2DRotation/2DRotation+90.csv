Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the orientation of the stroller in the left picture. It's positioned with the handle facing left and the wheels touching the ground.
2. Compare the first stroller's orientation with the stroller in the right picture. The stroller on the right has the handle pointing upwards and the wheels to the left side.
3. This indicates that the stroller has rotated clockwise.
4. By estimating the angle relative to the original, it appears the stroller has rotated 90 degrees to the right.
5. Therefore, the best rule that describes this transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

The object transforms from the left picture to the right picture by rotation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, the stroller is oriented horizontally with the handle on the left side and the wheels at the bottom.

2. In the right picture, the stroller is oriented vertically with the handle at the bottom and the wheels on the left side.

3. This indicates that the object has been rotated clockwise. 

4. To determine the degrees of rotation, I'll note the original orientation of a distinct part of the stroller such as the handle, which initially extends to the left.

5. In the right picture, the handle extends downward, which indicates a quarter turn (90 degrees) clockwise.

Thus, the objects turn 90 degrees from the left picture to the right picture.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

The transformation shown in the images appears to rotate the object, a stroller, by 90 degrees from the left image to the right image. To determine this, let's observe the relative positions of the wheels and the handle:

1. In the left image, the stroller is oriented with the handle to the left and the wheels at the bottom, in contact with an implied ground surface.
2. In the right image, the stroller has been turned so that the wheels are now on the left side and the handle points upwards, indicating a quarter-turn or 90-degree rotation.
3. There has been no reflection or inversion. The handle and wheels maintain their original configuration with respect to each other — only their orientation in space has changed.

Thus, the best rule to describe the transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

Starting with the picture on the left, we observe a dog standing with its front facing to the left of the image. In the picture on the right, the dog appears to have been rotated. To determine how much it has turned, let's examine the orientation changes:

Step 1: Examine the position of the head. On the left, the dog's head is upright and pointed to the left of the frame. On the right, the dog's head is now pointing downward towards the bottom of the frame.

Step 2: Look at the body orientation. The dog’s body, initially vertical, is now horizontal.

Step 3: Check the legs. Initially, the legs support the dog in an upright stance. After transformation, the legs now are oriented in such a way that they would have been if the dog rolled onto its back.

Considering the positional shift from an upright stance to one where the dog is on its back with its head pointing downward, we can surmise a 90-degree turn to the right has occurred. This is because the features that initially faced left now face downwards. The dog has not been turned a full 180 degrees, as this would result in the dog facing the opposite direction but still being upright. There has clearly been a change between pictures, which excludes option (3). Lastly, a change has occurred, so option (4) does not apply.

Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects turn 90",1,Objects turn 90 degrees
0,1,0,90,"(1) Objects turn 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I observe the object on the left, which is a dog in a standing position oriented with its head toward the top of the image.
2. Then I observe the object on the right, which is the same dog now appearing to be lying on its back with its paws up in the air. Notably, his head is now oriented toward the right side of the image.
3. The transition from the left image to the right image suggests that the dog has rotated along an axis running from head to tail. This is apparent because the position of the head has shifted from the top of the image to the right, indicating a quarter turn.
4. A quarter turn is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation along one axis.
   
Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation from the left image to the right image is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation from the left image to the right image, let's carefully observe the change in orientation of the object, which in this case is a dog.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left image, the dog is seated upright on its hind legs with its front paws down and head up.
2. In the right image, the dog appears to be lying on its back with its belly exposed and legs up in the air.
3. To achieve this orientation from the original position, the dog would have to rotate along an axis going from its head to tail.
4. This rotation appears to be 90 degrees clockwise when considering the three-dimensional space the dog occupies.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation of the shark from the left image to the right image step by step:

1. In the left image, the shark is horizontally oriented with its belly facing downward and its dorsal side (back) facing upward.

2. In the right image, the shark has been rotated. Its belly is now facing upward and its dorsal side is facing downward.

3. By examining the position of the shark's fins, eyes, and mouth, we can confirm that the shark has been rotated by 180 degrees around a horizontal axis that runs from the head to the tail. This has effectively flipped the shark from belly-down to belly-up.

Thus, the rule that best describes this transformation is that objects turn 180 degrees.",0,Objects turn 180 degrees
35,1,0,90,"(1)

Step 1: Observe the position of the shark in the left picture. It is oriented with its belly towards the bottom of the picture and its dorsal fin pointing upwards.

Step 2: Look at the position of the shark in the right picture. The shark is now oriented with its belly facing to the left and its dorsal fin pointing right, as if the shark were swimming upwards on the picture plane.

Step 3: Compare the orientations between the two pictures. The shark has rotated in such a way that if we imagine a clock face overlaying the shark in the left picture, the head of the shark would have moved from the 6 o'clock position to the 9 o'clock position in the right picture.

Step 4: Determine the degree of rotation. A quarter turn (90 degrees) in a clockwise direction from the 6 o'clock to the 9 o'clock position matches the observed transformation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

In the given image of the shark transformation from left to right, here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the initial orientation of the shark on the left. Note the position of its fins and the direction its belly is facing.
2. Compare this to the orientation of the shark on the right. The shark appears to have rotated, with its belly now facing the opposite direction, and the fins that were on the bottom are now on the top.
3. A 180-degree turn would have the shark upside down, but with its head and tail still pointing in the same direction. Since the head and tail are now pointing in the opposite direction, this indicates a 90-degree rotation.
4. To confirm whether the orientation change is indeed 90 degrees, consider that a 90-degree turn from the perspective shown would indeed invert the position of the belly and back, as in the image on the right.
5. Based on this analysis, the shark has been rotated 90 degrees from its original position in the left image to its position in the right image. Therefore, the rule that ""Objects turn 90 degrees"" applies.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To determine the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation, let's compare the orientations of the object in both images step by step:

1. Observe the object in the left picture. It appears to be an 'L' shaped sofa with the longer side extending to the left.

2. Now, look at the object in the right picture; it's the same 'L' shaped sofa, but now the longer side extends upwards.

3. To achieve this transformation by rotation, the sofa would need to be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around an axis that runs from the front to the back through the corner where the two sides of the 'L' meet.

4. This single 90-degree rotation changes the orientation of the sofa from a horizontal position to a vertical one (relative to the original orientation in the left picture).

This analysis shows that the correct rule is that the objects turn 90 degrees, hence rule number (2).",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To determine the transformation of the object from left to right, let's examine its orientation carefully:

- In the left picture, the L-shaped couch is oriented with the shorter section on the bottom right.

- In the right picture, the orientation of the L-shaped couch has changed. The shorter section of the couch is now on the bottom left.

This indicates that the couch has been rotated. To find out the degree of rotation:

- If we imagine rotating the couch in the left picture 90 degrees counterclockwise, the shorter section would indeed end up at the bottom left, just as it appears in the right picture.

Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To understand the transformation, let's look at the object in the left picture and observe how it changes in the right picture:

1. Identify the orientation of the object in the left picture. Notice the shape and which side the armrests are on.
2. Compare the orientation with the right picture. 
3. The right armrest in the left picture becomes the farthest part of the couch in the right picture, indicating that the object has turned.
4. To confirm the degree of rotation, visualize the couch in the left picture turning clockwise until it matches the position in the right picture. This occurs with a 90-degree rotation.

Therefore, the rule best describing the left-to-right transformation is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To solve the visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation step by step:

1. Observe the object in the left picture: This is a croissant with its curve facing downward and the ends pointing to the left and right.

2. Now let's look at the object in the right picture: The croissant now has its curve facing upward, and the ends are pointing to the left and the top.

3. Determine the transformation: By comparing the orientation of the croissant in both pictures, we can see that the croissant has been rotated. 

4. Quantify the rotation: The croissant has been rotated in such a way that what was the bottom has now become the top. This indicates a 90-degree rotation.

With these observations, it is clear that the rule that best describes this transformation is that the object turns 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the left image, we have an object that appears to be a croissant with the curved edge facing downwards and the two tips pointing to the left and up.

2. In the right image, the same object appears with the curved edge now facing upwards and the two tips pointing to the right and down.

3. If we were to mentally rotate the object in the left image, we would see that it needs to turn clockwise (to the right) to achieve the orientation of the object in the right image.

4. The amount of rotation appears to be a quarter turn, which is 90 degrees.

5. Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that objects turn 90 degrees (rule 2).",1,Objects turn 90 degrees

To determine the transformation rule that applies to the object between the left and right images, let’s analyze the pictures step by step:

1. Identify the object: The object in both pictures is a croissant.
2. Compare their orientation: The croissant on the left is oriented with the curve opening towards the upper left, while the croissant on the right is oriented with the curve opening towards the upper right.
3. Determine the angle of rotation: The croissant appears to have rotated clockwise. If we imagine a clock face overlaying the croissant in the left image with its center at the midpoint of the croissant, the croissant rotates from roughly a 9 o'clock - 3 o'clock position to a 12 o'clock - 6 o'clock position.
4. Estimate the degree of rotation: The rotation described would be 90 degrees since it moves from one primary position to another (e.g., horizontal to vertical).

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the best description of the transformation between the left and right images is that the objects turn 90 degrees.",1,Objects turn 90 degrees
