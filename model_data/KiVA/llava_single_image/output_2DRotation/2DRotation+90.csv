This transformation follows the rule (2) Orientation of objects, as the object's orientation changes from upside down to sideways to right side up in the left-to-right sequence.</s>","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a change in the orientation of the object by 90 degrees. In the image, the object is shown in different orientations, such as upside down, sideways, or right side up. This change in orientation is a characteristic of the transformation rule (2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The object is shown in an upside-down orientation on the left side.
2. The object is transformed to a sideways orientation in the middle.
3. The object is transformed to a right side up orientation on the right side.

This transformation follows the rule (2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees, as the object's orientation changes from upside down to sideways to right side up in the left-to-right sequence.</s>","(A)

The left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is the one marked by (A).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The object is shown in an upside-down orientation on the left side.
2. The object is transformed to a sideways orientation in the middle.
3. The object is transformed to a right side up orientation on the right side.

This transformation follows the same pattern as the transformation on the top of the puzzle, with the object's orientation changing from upside down to sideways to right side up in the left-to-right sequence.</s>",1,1,1
