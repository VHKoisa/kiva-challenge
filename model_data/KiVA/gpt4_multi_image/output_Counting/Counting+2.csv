- In the left image, there is one object depicted: a balloon with a string.
- In the right image, there are three objects that are identical to the single object in the left image: balloons with strings.
- The color, size, and orientation of the balloons have not changed between the two images.

- In the initial transformation, a single object on the left turned into three identical objects on the right. This indicates that the number of objects increased by two.
- Looking at the three provided options:

The transformation rule that applies from the left picture to the right picture dictates that:

2. In the right picture, there are three balloons.

By counting the number of balloons in each picture, we can observe that the number increases by two when going from the left picture to the right picture. Hence, the rule ""Things go up by 2"" applies as the transformation involves adding two additional","(C)

From the left image to the right image, the number of dog-shaped objects decreases by two. Initially, there are four objects, and on the right, there are two objects.

In the image on the left, there are four camel silhouettes displayed next to each other. In the image on the right, there are three camel silhouettes.

The transformation from the picture on the left to the picture on the right shows a reduction in the number of camel silhouettes - from four camels down to three.

In transformation (C), there are five drums on the left side and three drums on the right side. This shows that the number of drums has decreased by two, which matches the transformation we observed at the beginning with the squirrels, where the number of objects decreased by two from the left image to the right image.

The transformation from the left picture to the right picture does not show any change in the count or position of the objects.

Option (C) is the correct answer because it shows the same transformation as the initial image. In both the initial image and image (C), the transformation involves the number of objects increasing by one from the left side of the image to the right side. Specifically:
