# KiVA: Kid-inspired Visual Analogies

KiVA: Kid-inspired Visual Analogies is a visual analogical reasoning benchmark designed to probe fundamental visual pattern recognition and abstraction skills in large multimodal models. The benchmark features real-world object transformations that are supported by developmental psychology and are tested to be solvable by young children at the age of 3. 

In this repository, you will find:

**Dataset**: all object transformation stimuli for both the original task and the hard task, and code used to generate the various transformations in the benchmark (Object_Transformations.py) 

**Model Queries**: model query scripts for GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5 and MANTIS, including single-image and multi-image queries as well as prompts used for in-context learning and prompt engineering (code, instructions, reflection)

**Model Outputs**: raw outputs from models for both the original visual analogies (original task) and the next-level hard visual analogies (hard task)
