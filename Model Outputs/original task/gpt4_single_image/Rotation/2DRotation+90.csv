Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- The number of dogs remains the same between the two images, which rules out (1) Number of objects.
- The color of the dog does not change, which rules out (2) Color of objects.
- There is no option that is without any changes, which means (4) No change between pictures is not applicable.
- Since there are changes, (5) Doesn't apply is also not applicable.

The only visible transformation is the orientation of the dog. In the left image, the dog is oriented with its paws down, standing on the invisible ground. In the right image, the dog is flipped over, with its paws up in the air. Hence, the correct answer that describes the transformation is that the orientation of the object changes.","The rule that best describes the transformation in the top of the puzzle is (1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Looking at the left image on top, the dog is in an upright position with its stomach facing downwards.
- In the right image on top, the dog has been flipped to a position where its back is now facing downwards, indicating a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis.
- This rotation changes the dog from standing to being upside-down, which is consistent with a half-turn, or 180 degrees.
- The transformation does not qualify for a 90-degree rotation, as that would result in the dog being on its side rather than completely inverted.
- There is a clear change between the two pictures, so (3) No change between pictures does not apply.
- Since a specific transformation (180-degree rotation) is identified, (4) Doesn't apply is not the correct answer.

Hence, the transformation of the dog from the upright position to the upside-down position is accurately described by a rotation of 180 degrees, which is denoted with the rule number (1).","The transformation that is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is (B).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- We have established in the previous answer that the transformation at the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the object (the dog) from standing to upside-down.
- Now, we must find which set of transformations among (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom displays a similar 180-degree rotation.

Analyzing each option:
- Option (A) shows two images of a submarine with the same orientation, so there is no observable rotation or change in orientation.
- Option (B) shows a submarine that appears to rotate by 180 degrees from left to right. In the left image, the submarine is horizontal with its top side visible. In the right image, the submarine is still horizontal, but it has been flipped to show the bottom side, representing a 180-degree rotation around the longitudinal axis.
- Option (C) shows two submarines with the same orientation, like (A), and hence no rotation or flip occurs.

Thus, option (B) matches the transformation seen at the top with the dog, which is a 180-degree rotation. The correct answer is (B).",1,0,1
0,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(3) Orientation of objects

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The top two images show the transformation of a dog from an upright standing position to being upside down. This change represents a shift in the orientation of the dog.
- The size of the dog remains constant, no new dogs are introduced, and the color remains the same.
- Looking at the objects on the bottom, which are airships or blimps, sequence (B) shows a similar transformation to the one seen with the dog: the orientation of the airship changes from the left image to the right image while the size, number, and color remain constant.
- Since the transformation that best matches the one observed with the dog at the top is the change in orientation, the correct rule is number (3) for orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Observing the two images of the dog at the top, we can see that the dog in the left picture is standing upright, while in the right picture, the dog appears to be rotated such that it is upside down.
- This upside-down orientation of the dog in the right image compared to the left image indicates that it has undergone a 180-degree rotation about an axis.
- There is no indication of a 90-degree rotation, and there is a clear change between the left and right pictures, which means rules (1) and (3) do not apply.
- Rule (4) does not apply because a specific transformation can be identified.
- Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation from left to right for the top images is a rotation by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule (2).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The transformation at the top involves the dog rotating by 180 degrees from the left picture to the right picture.
- To find the matching transformation at the bottom, we need to look for a similar rotation of 180 degrees.
- Option (A) shows an airship turned sideways, which is not a 180-degree rotation but rather a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (B) shows the airship rotating 180 degrees from left to right, similar to the dog's transformation.
- Option (C) does not depict a rotation but instead shows the airship moving slightly to the side without altering its orientation in a significant way.
- Since option (B) is the transformation that matches the 180-degree rotation seen in the top puzzle, the correct answer is (B).",1,0,0
0,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(2) Orientation of objects

Step-by-step reasoning:
- When comparing the top left and right images featuring the dog, the change is clearly in the orientation of the dog. The dog goes from an upright position on the left to a rotated position on its back on the right.
- This change is not related to the size of the dog, as the dog remains the same size in both images.
- There is no change in the color of the dog between the two images.
- There is a change between the pictures, so option (4) ""No change between pictures"" does not apply.
- Since only the orientation has changed, none of the other rules, such as a change in size, color, or number of objects, apply here. Thus, rule (5) ""Doesn't apply"" is not relevant to this transformation.

Therefore, the transformation that best describes the left-to-right change on the top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects, which is rule (2).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Observing the top left and right images showing the dog, it's clear that there's been a rotation involved in the transformation from one image to the other.
- The dog is initially in an upright standing position and is then shown lying on its back. This change suggests a half-turn or a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal (or possibly sagittal) plane.
- The rotation isn't 90 degrees because that would imply the dog would be on its side rather than its back.
- There is definitely a change between the pictures, so rule (3) ""No change between pictures"" does not apply.
- Since the rotation is identifiable, and the transformation involves the dog being rotated, rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is also not relevant in this case.

Thus, the transformation that best describes the left-to-right change on the top of the puzzle is a 180-degree rotation of the objects, which corresponds to rule (2).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We previously established that the transformation on the top of the puzzle involves a 180-degree rotation of the object (the dog).
- We now need to analyze the transformations (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

(A) shows two airships that remain in the same position and orientation, implying there's no rotation or transformation occurring.

(B) shows an airship that has been rotated 180 degrees around its longitudinal axis, switching from an upright position similar to the dog's initial stance to an upside-down position similar to the dog's rotated position on the top.

(C) shows two airships in the same orientation with no rotation evident between them.

- The only transformation at the bottom that matches the top transformation of a 180-degree rotation is in (B).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) because it shows the same kind of 180-degree rotation that is present in the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle.",1,0,1

3. On the right side, the desk fan has been rotated to lie on its side, maintaining its color, size, and shape. None of these properties have changed; only the orientation is different.
4. Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects, which is rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examining the top pair of images, we can see a desk fan in two different orientations.
2. The fan is initially upright, standing on its base in the left image.
3. In the right image, the fan has been rotated so that it is now lying on its side.
4. The rotation appears to be 90 degrees because the fan moves from a vertical position to a horizontal one.
5. Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows the fan being rotated by 90 degrees from standing upright to lying on its side.
2. We now need to analyze the bottom three transformations, options (A), (B), and (C), to find a similar transformation.

For (A), the packet of fries rotates but does not match the 90-degree rotation we see with the fan; it appears to be a rotation along a different axis.

For (B), again, the fries packet rotates, but this time it is merely tipped forward, not rotated by 90 degrees onto its side.

For (C), the fries packet is rotated from an upright position to lying on its side, mirroring the same type of 90-degree rotational change we see in the fan's transformation.

- The object on the right is the same desk fan, but now it is lying on its side with the front of the fan pointing to the right.
- The transition from the first orientation to the second indicates a quarter turn, which is a 90-degree rotation.

  - (B) shows the carton being rotated by approximately 90 degrees to the side, similar to the fan's rotation.
  - (C) shows the carton moving from the right side to the left, which is a translation rather than a rotation.

1. The object on top changes from left to right, and during this transformation, the size, number, and color of the fan remain constant.
2. The only change that occurs is in the orientation of the fan; it is rotated around its axis.
3. Given these observations, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of the object (Rule 3).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

1. Observing the transformation of the fan from the left to the right, we can focus on the base of the fan, which has a rectangular shape with a blue button.
2. In the first image, the longer side of the rectangular base is horizontal, and the blue button is on the right side.
3. In the second image, the longer side of the base has become vertical, indicating a quarter turn, and the blue button is now on the top. 
4. This is consistent with a 90-degree rotation of the object.

- In option (A), the box of fries undergoes a change from an upright position to being tilted onto its side. This is not simply a 90-degree rotation around the axis; it looks to be changing in orientation in a way that also alters the perspective of the fries within it, and it's not a rotation in the same plane.
- In option (B), the box of fries starts upright and then appears to rotate by 90 degrees to rest on one of its sides. This matches the type of transformation we observed in the fan above, which is a 90-degree rotation around its axis.
- In option (C), there is no rotation; instead, the box of fries is duplicated, resulting in two identical boxes.

3. Only the transformation shown in option (B) exhibits a 90-degree rotation similar to that of the transformation at the top with the fan.

- The rocking horse itself doesn't change in size, number, or color between the two images. It remains brown with the same design and features.
- What does change is the orientation of the rocking horse. It goes from an upright position on the left to a tipped over position on the right.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

- Observing the top section of the puzzle, we see a rocking horse in two different positions from left to right.
- In the left image, the rocking horse is upright, indicating a certain orientation.
- In the right image, the rocking horse has been tipped over to its side. The specific orientation change indicates a rotation.
- The change from upright to lying on its side is consistent with a 90-degree rotation around the axis that would be perpendicular to the ground if the horse were standing upright.
- Since there is no indication that the rotation is a full 180 degrees (which would invert the horse but keep it upright), and there is clearly a change between the pictures, the only rule that fits is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

(A):
- The object in (A) does not appear to rotate; it remains in the same orientation between the left and right images.

(B):
- The object in (B) is rotating, but the rotation appears to be less than 90 degrees as the object is not completely on its side in the right image.

(C):
- Finally, the object in (C) shows the same orientation in the left image as on top, and then it rotates to be completely on its side in the right image, like the rocking horse in the top sequence.

- Therefore, the transformation that best describes the left-to-right sequence on top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects, hence rule (1).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The first image shows the horse facing left, and the second image shows the horse facing right.
- Clearly, the horse has been turned to face the exact opposite direction, which indicates a rotation of 180 degrees.
- There were no rotations that would indicate 90 degrees shown since the horse has actually completed half a full turn (360 degrees) to face the opposite way.
- There are changes between the pictures, so (3) does not apply, and since a specific rotation is identified, (4) does not apply either.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, corresponding to rule (1).","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We have already established that the transformation at the top features a rotation of the object by 180 degrees.

Looking at the bottom transformations:
- Option (A) shows the transformation of an object that is upside-down in the first image and then is right-side up in the second image. This indicates a 180-degree rotation.
- Option (B) depicts an object with the same orientation in both images, indicating no rotation has occurred.
- Option (C) shows an object that appears to have been rotated, but not by a full 180 degrees, as it's not completely upside down or right-side up in comparison to its counterpart.

2. However, the orientation of the rocking horse has changed. In the first image, it is standing upright in a standard position. In the second image, the rocking horse is turned upside down.

1. Observe the two images of the rocking horse at the top of the puzzle. The rocking horse in the first image is in an upright position, and in the second image, it is upside down.

2. To go from the first position to the second, the rocking horse would have to be rotated half a turn around a horizontal axis, which is equivalent to a rotation of 180 degrees.

3. There is no indication that the rocking horse has been rotated by only 90 degrees, as that would result in the object being on its side, which is not the case here. Similarly, option (3) can be discarded because there is a noticeable change between the pictures.

3. In transformation (A), the object – which appears to be a round creature wearing a helmet – is facing the same direction in both images, so there is no rotation by 180 degrees.

2. Look at the object on the top right: It's the same molecule-like structure but has been rotated or flipped to a different orientation.
3. Notice that the size, number, and color of the balls and sticks in the molecule have not changed; the only transformation that has occurred is the change in the way the structure is oriented.

2. Look at the object on the top right: It is the same molecule-like structure, with the same color and number of balls and sticks.
3. Notice the positional relationship of the colored balls in the structure. Specifically, consider a prominent pink ball on the left of the original structure; in the transformed structure, this pink ball is now on the right, assuming a mirrored or flipped position.
4. There is no intermediate position that suggests a mere 90-degree rotation, especially when considering the 3D nature of the structure. The change is not consistent with a simple 90-degree rotation on a single axis.
5. Taking into account the spatial arrangements, it's evident that the structure has been flipped around a central axis — this corresponds to a 180-degree rotation.

- First, observe the transformation from the left image to the right image at the top of the puzzle. The object, which appears to be a molecule model, rotates from an initial position to a final position.
- There is no change in size, as the individual spheres and connectors maintain consistent proportions throughout the transformation.
- The number of components (spheres and connectors) in the molecule model does not change; there are the same number of each before and after the rotation.
- The color of the molecule model remains constant, with pink spheres and grey/white connectors.
- No new elements are introduced and no elements disappear; thus, rule 4 (No change between pictures) and rule 5 (Doesn't apply) are not relevant.
- The most relevant transformation is the change in the orientation of the molecule model. The entire object appears to rotate around an axis, changing how it is facing relative to the viewer.

Thus, the best description of the transformation occurring at the top of the puzzle is the change in the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In examining the transformation from the left to the right image at the top of the puzzle, we should focus on the orientation change of the molecule model.
- A careful look at the molecule model shows that the orientation change is significant: the molecule model appears upside-down in the right image compared to the left image.
- The connectors and the larger spheres that were on the top on the left image are now at the bottom in the right image, and vice versa. This indicates a half-turn or a 180-degree rotation.
- A 90-degree rotation would only have placed the molecule model on its side, not completely flipped it upside down. Therefore, rule (2) can be excluded.
- Since there is an obvious change in orientation, rule (3) stating no change is not applicable.
- Rule (4) also does not apply as there is a clear rule governing the transformation, which is the object undergoing rotation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Upon observing the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle:

- Transformation (A) shows the object rotating, but it is not a 180-degree rotation as evidenced by the position of the ears and the eyes. The ears and eyes are aligned vertically in the first image and horizontally in the second, suggesting a 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (B) exhibits a change where the second object is an inverted version of the first, which aligns with a 180-degree rotation. The bottom remains consistent, the eyes are in reversed positions, and the ears, which were previously at the top, are now at the bottom.
- Transformation (C) shows a change in the object's orientation, but it is less than a 180-degree rotation. The ears show that the object has been rotated slightly to the left, not flipped upside down.
- Since only transformation (B) displays a full 180-degree rotation, corresponding with the molecule model's rotation at the top of the puzzle, it is the correct answer.

- The size of the molecule appears consistent between the left and right images, indicating that the transformation does not involve a change in size (rejecting rule 1).
- The number of atoms and bonds in the molecule remains the same, indicating that the transformation does not involve a change in the number of objects (rejecting rule 2).
- The color of the molecule parts remains the same, so rule 4 (no change between pictures) is not applicable given that a change does occur, and rule 5 (doesn't apply) also does not fit the observed change.
- The most noticeable difference between the two pictures at the top is the rotation or reorientation of the molecule, which is consistent with rule 3 (orientation of objects).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- First, we establish that the objects are indeed rotating between the left and right images at the top of the puzzle. We can tell this by looking at the orientation of the molecule model.
- The molecule's distinct arrangement of bonds and atoms allows us to track its rotation. By comparing the position of the larger central spheres and the direction the bonds point towards, we can see that the entire molecule has undergone a half-turn.
- A 180-degree rotation would flip the object over into a position where it would appear as a mirror image of its original orientation along the axis of rotation. This is consistent with the molecule's transformation from the left to the right image.
- The transformation is not a 90-degree rotation since the orientation change is more substantial; after a 90-degree rotation, the bonds would be pointing in a direction perpendicular to their current direction rather than the opposite direction.
- There is a change between the pictures, hence rule 3 does not apply.
- Since the appropriate transformation is specified by one of the given options, rule 4 (doesn't apply) is also not relevant.
- Therefore, the rule that best fits the transformation we observe is a 180-degree rotation of the object, which corresponds to rule 1.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given that we have identified the transformation at the top of the puzzle to be a rotation of 180 degrees, we will now compare that transformation to the three pairs of objects at the bottom of the puzzle marked (A), (B), and (C).
- Starting with pair (A), it is evident that the transformation is not a 180-degree rotation. Instead, there is an additional feature on the second figure, which appears to be ears, and the orientation of the figure has not changed in a way that suggests rotation at all.
- Moving on to pair (B), we also don't see a transformation that indicates a 180-degree rotation. The object in the first image is oriented slightly differently in the second image, but the direction of the eye and the shape of the object do not match a 180-degree rotation.
- Finally, looking at pair (C), we see that the first object is oriented with the oval-shaped hole on its right side, and in the second image, this hole has moved to the left side. Without any other difference in the details or position of the eye, this transformation matches a 180-degree rotation along the vertical axis of the object.

2. The first ship is shown with its bow pointing to the left, while in the second image, the ship is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, with the bow pointing downwards.
3. This change does not involve a change in size, color, or number of objects; rather, it's a change in the orientation of the object.
4. Therefore, rule (1) Orientation of objects best describes the transformation in the top row.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top row, we can see a three-dimensional model of a ship in two different states.
2. The ship on the left is oriented with its bow pointing to the left.
3. The ship on the right is rotated in such a way that the bow is now pointing down.
4. The rotation between the left and right images of the ship is exactly 90 degrees clockwise.
5. There are no other transformations such as 180-degree rotation, no change, or an inapplicable transformation present.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The rule identified for the transformation at the top of the puzzle is (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.
2. Now we will compare this transformation rule to the three options provided at the bottom of the puzzle to find a match:

   - Option (A): The grape cluster on the left is oriented with what appears to be the top of the cluster pointing to the left. In the image on the right, the cluster is rotated such that the top is now pointing up. This represents a 90-degree rotation clockwise, which matches the transformation seen on the top. However, there is also a change in the number of grapes, which does not occur in the top transformation, so this is not an exact match.

   - Option (B): The grape cluster on the left is oriented with the top of the cluster pointing to the left. In the image on the right, the cluster is rotated such that the top of the cluster is now pointing down. This is a 90-degree rotation clockwise, exactly matching the transformation observed in the ship on the top.

   - Option (C): The grape cluster on the left is positioned with the top of the cluster pointing up. On the right, the cluster is rotated such that the top is now pointing to the right. This is a 90-degree rotation clockwise but in a different direction compared to the transformation of the ship on the top.

- The top transformation shows a ship which changes its orientation from the left picture to the right picture.
- The color remains the same (gray, brown, and white tones).
- The size of the ship remains the same.
- The number of ships is consistent (one in each picture).
- Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation is related to the orientation of the object, which is rule number 3.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top part of the puzzle, the ship on the left is upright with its top facing up.
- The ship on the right is upside down, with its top facing down.
- This change in position indicates a rotation of 180 degrees between the left and the right pictures.
- This rotation is neither 90 degrees nor a lack of change.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which is rule number 2.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We have previously established that the transformation at the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the object.
- Now, examining the transformations on the bottom:

   - Option (A) shows grapes with a slight change in orientation, but it is not a full 180-degree rotation.
   - Option (B) shows the grapes rotating; the bunch of grapes in the right image is upside down compared to the left image, indicating a 180-degree rotation, similar to the ship's transformation at the top.
   - Option (C) has no change in orientation between the left and right images; the bunch of grapes remains in the same upright position.

3. This change represents a change in orientation.
4. There is no change in size, number, or color of the object between the two pictures.

2. In the first picture, the object is a ship facing left, and in the second picture, the ship is facing right.
3. The ship has completed a half-turn, which means it has rotated by 180 degrees.
4. There is no indication of a 90-degree rotation, nor is there any aspect of the transformation that suggests no change or an unrelated rule.

2. Look at each of the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle to find a similar rule being applied.
3. Option (A) shows no rotation but a change in perspective from front to slightly tilted upward.
4. Option (B) shows a rotation, but the grapes are only rotated partially and not by 180 degrees.
5. Option (C) shows the grapes rotating from facing left to facing right which is a 180-degree rotation, similar to the ship's transformation at the top.

The left-to-right transformation of the object on top of the puzzle shows a log that is changing its orientation. In the left image, the log is oriented with its end facing up, while in the right image the same log is oriented with its end facing to the right. The size, color, and number of the logs remain constant, so those rules do not apply. The only change observed between the two pictures is the orientation of the object, which aligns with rule number (3).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the transformation at the top of the puzzle, the log rotates from an upright position to a horizontal position. This type of rotation represents a quarter turn, which is equal to 90 degrees. There are no other changes to the object other than its orientation. This means that rule (1) does not apply since it is not a 180-degree rotation; rule (3) does not apply because there is a change occurring between the pictures; and rule (4) does not apply because rule (2) perfectly describes the transformation. Thus, the correct rule is (2), indicating a 90-degree rotation of the object.","(C)

Comparing the top transformation with those at the bottom labeled (A), (B), and (C), we are looking for a 90-degree rotation of the object, as determined previously.

- (B) displays the mouse with no rotation at all; it remains oriented the same way in both pictures.
- (C) features the mouse rotating from facing down and to the left to facing down and to the right, which is a 90-degree rotation around the axis of its tail.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top transformation shows a log that has rotated from a horizontal position to a slightly titled upright position. 
- The change between the two images on top is purely in the way the object is oriented. The size, number, and color remain the same.
- Looking at the options (A), (B), and (C) considering that we already defined the relationship on the top as orientation:
  - (A) shows a mouse that is rotating as it moves from left to right.
  - (B) shows a consistent orientation of the mouse but its number increases with each frame.
  - (C) shows a mouse that is also rotating as it moves from left to right.
- Since the top series of images is about the orientation change of objects, option (A) and (C) follow this rule whereas (B) does not, as it follows an increase in a number rather than a change in orientation.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The log on top shows a transformation from lying flat to standing upright, which is indicative of a 90-degree rotation.
- Comparing the left and right positions of the log, it appears that the log has been rotated around its longitudinal axis to go from horizontal to vertical.
- This rotation is less than 180 degrees because a full 180-degree rotation would invert the log, making the currently visible underside face up.
- The transformation is clearly not a full rotation (360 degrees) and more than a quarter turn (90 degrees), resulting in the log standing on one end.
- There is a change between the pictures, so rules (3) and (4) do not apply.
- Therefore, the most accurate description of the transformation is a 90-degree rotation of the object.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation on the top involves a 90-degree rotation of the log from lying flat to a vertical position.
- We are looking for a similar transformation among the options (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom that involves a rotation of 90 degrees.

Analyzing the options:
- (A) shows a mouse that is rotating, but the rotation is less than 90 degrees and is more of a horizontal pivot than the vertical rotation we see in the top transformation.
- (B) shows a change in the number of mice rather than any rotation, so it does not match the type of transformation from the top.
- (C) shows a mouse that starts off lying flat and ends up rotated by approximately 90 degrees to stand on its hind legs. This closely matches the 90-degree rotation seen in the top transformation.

Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because it demonstrates the same kind of 90-degree rotation as the transformation depicted on the top of the puzzle.",1,1,1

The transformation on top of the puzzle appears to involve the object's orientation:

- The first image on the top shows the object (which looks like a piece of candy or a wooden block) with its longest side lying horizontally.
- The second image on the top shows the same object rotated so that its longest side is now vertical.

Analyzing the transformations from left to right in individual sequences, we can observe the following for each bottom series:

- In sequence (A), the object (a mouse) undergoes rotation. In the first image, the mouse is facing upwards, and in the second image, the mouse is rotated to face right.
- In sequence (B), the first image shows the mouse facing upwards, and in the second image, the mouse is rotated slightly clockwise but still essentially facing up.
- In sequence (C), the orientation of the mouse does not change between the two images; it remains facing upwards.

Given this information, it is clear that the transformation rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects.","(1)

Focusing on the transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's observe the change step by step:

- The object in the first image at the top appears to have its longest side lying horizontally.
- The object in the second image appears to have been rotated because its longest side is now vertical.

This indicates that between the first and second images, the object has been rotated. Since the rotation changed the orientation of the longest side from horizontal to vertical, this is indicative of a 90-degree rotation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation where the picture on the left transforms to the picture on the right at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(A)

To determine which sequence on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation at the top, where the object rotates by 90 degrees, let's examine the bottom sequences:

- In sequence (A), the mouse rotates from facing upwards to facing right. This is a 90-degree rotation, which matches the transformation we observed at the top.
- In sequence (B), the mouse also rotates, but it does not complete a 90-degree turn; it looks like a lesser rotation, possibly around 45 degrees.
- In sequence (C), there is no rotation or change in the orientation of the object; the mouse maintains the same direction.

Given these observations, the correct sequence that matches the 90-degree rotation transformation at the top of the puzzle is sequence (A).",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We begin by observing the transformations on the top part of the puzzle, which includes two images of what appears to be a partial piano or a similar keyboard instrument.
2. Looking at the left image, the piano keys are on the bottom with the wooden part on the top. In the right image, the orientation has changed so that the piano keys are on the top with the wooden part on the bottom.
3. There is no change in colour, the number of objects remains consistent as we just have a single object, and there is no indication of a change in size between the left and right images.
4. Thus, we can deduce that the transformation occurring from left to right for the object on the top is a change in orientation.
5. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is about the orientation of objects, which corresponds to rule number (2).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. As previously noted, the transformation involves the change in orientation of the top images of the puzzle, which are images of a partial piano or similar keyboard instrument.
2. Initially, the keys of the piano are oriented downwards and the wooden part upwards in the left image.
3. In the right image, the keys are now oriented upwards and the wooden part downwards.
4. This change in orientation is consistent with a rotation, and to achieve this specific change, the object would have been rotated by 180 degrees around an axis in the plane of the image (essentially a flip).
5. No other degree of rotation would result in this specific top-to-bottom flip of the piano keys and wooden part.
6. There is no other transformation, such as translation or scaling, evident between the two images.
7. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We've established that the transformation at the top involves the object (piano) rotating 180 degrees.
2. To find the matching transformation on the bottom, we will look for a similar rotation in the objects displayed in options A, B, and C.

   - (A) shows two clapperboards (objects used in film). In the left image, the top part of the clapperboard is facing to the left, and in the right image, it is facing to the right. This orientation change signifies a 180-degree rotation around a vertical axis.
  
   - (B) shows the clapperboards having undergone a rotation as well; however, the rotation seems to be only 90 degrees since the top part of the clapperboard is facing upwards in the left image and downwards in the right image.

   - (C) displays two clapperboards in the left image and two clapperboards in the right image without any apparent rotation or flip; the objects remain facing the same direction.

3. Only option (A) shows a transformation where the objects have rotated 180 degrees, consistent with the transformation observed in the top part of the puzzle.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top of the puzzle, the transformation is from a broken piano to a whole piano. The whole piano is oriented somewhat differently than the broken piano, suggesting a change in orientation.

2. There is no change in the size of the piano as it goes from broken to whole, so rule (1) does not apply.

3. The number of objects (pianos) remains the same, so rule (2) does not apply.

4. Since there is a change (from broken to whole), rule (4) does not apply.

5. Rule (5) is a generic rule that should not be chosen if any specific change can be identified.

Conclusively, the most evident transformation between the two pictures is the change in the orientation of the object from the left to the right. Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation is the orientation of objects, which is rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the transformation at the top of the puzzle, the broken piano on the left undergoes a change to become a whole piano on the right. Specifically, the orientation of the piano has changed.

2. Upon closely examining the orientation of the piano, it appears that the broken piano initially faces with the keyboard part to the right and the body part to the left. After the transformation, the whole piano faces the opposite direction with the keyboard part to the left and the body part to the right. This suggests a rotation.

3. The rotation that would cause such a change in orientation is a 180-degree flip around a central axis. This particular rotation makes the left side become the right side, which is consistent with the observed transformation.

4. A 90-degree rotation (rule (2)) would not result in this orientation change, as it would show the piano in a completely different perspective (e.g., from the side or top-down).

5. Since there is a noticeable difference between the pictures, rule (3) does not apply.

6. Rule (4) is nonspecific and not chosen if a more specific description of the change can be identified.

Conclusively, the rule that best describes the transformation observed at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(C)

2. We now need to apply this rule to the three pairs of objects on the bottom of the puzzle to identify the matching transformation.

3. For option (A), it looks like the two objects change in orientation, but not through a clear 180-degree rotation. The orientation change appears more complicated than a simple flip.

4. For option (B), the two objects differ in how they are standing. The object on the right is standing upright, while the object on the left is lying on its side, indicating a 90-degree rotation rather than a 180-degree rotation.

5. Option (C) shows a pair of objects that are mirrored along a vertical axis, which is a telltale sign of a 180-degree rotation in the plane of the image.

Given this information, option (C) is the transformation that matches the one observed at the top of the puzzle since it features a 180-degree rotation, identical to the rotation of the piano from broken to intact.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top transformation depicts a change from the left image to right where the object, which appears to be a partially broken musical instrument (specifically a piano), undergoes a rotation or a change in orientation.
- The difference between the two images is not due to color because the colors remain consistent between the two images.
- The size of the object does not seem to change either; it remains the same size from the left image to the right image.
- The number of objects remains constant - there is one item in both images.
- Therefore, the rule that best fits this transformation is the change in orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Focusing on the top transformation with the piano-like object, we notice that the left image has the broken piano oriented with its keys facing the left and the broken edge facing downward.
- In the right image, the piano has been flipped so that the keys now face the right and the broken edge is upward.
- This change in orientation is consistent with a 180-degree rotation, as the piano appears to be upside down in the second image compared to its orientation in the first.
- The rotation is not 90 degrees because the image does not show the piano sideways, which would be expected with a 90-degree turn.

  (B) shows a pair of objects where the left image has an object that seems to be 'standing' while the right image has that same object now 'lying down,' which indicates it has undergone a rotation.

To solve this visual puzzle, we need to look at the top transformation of an object (a piece of cake with strawberries on top) and determine how it changes from the left image to the right image.

- Looking at the top images, we see a piece of cake with strawberries on it.
- In the first image, the cake is positioned so that a triangular face is visible from the front.
- In the second image, the cake has been rotated so that the strawberry is now coming towards the viewer, which means the orientation of the cake has changed from the left to the right image.
- There are no changes in the size, number, or color of the object; only the orientation has changed.
- Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To determine the rule for the transformation observed at the top of the puzzle, we should evaluate the rotation that the object (the piece of cake with strawberries) undergoes from the left image to the right image.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the left image, we see the cake with its triangular face visible and the strawberries on top.
- In the right image, the cake is now oriented in such a way that the strawberries are pointing towards the viewer.
- This change in orientation indicates a rotation. Specifically, it appears to be a 90-degree rotation around the vertical axis, which makes the top of the cake (where the strawberries are placed) face the viewer.
- The cake has not been flipped upside down or rotated in any other increments, therefore a 180-degree rotation (rule 1) does not apply, as such a rotation would invert the cake.
- There has indeed been a change between the pictures, ruling out rule 3, and a specific transformation has occurred, so rule 4 is also not applicable.
- Ergo, the correct rule is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Option (B): The shoe rotates but appears to stay in the same plane and pivots at a point that is not a 90-degree turn. It does not match the rotation of the cake piece at the top.

Option (C): The shoe in the first image is facing left, and in the second image, it has been rotated to face right. This matches the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation where the cake has been rotated to bring the top (with the strawberries) to face the viewer.

The position of the strawberry relative to the cake piece remains the same; it's the orientation of the cake piece that changes. 

The size, color, and number of the components (the cake piece and the strawberry) remain consistent between the two pictures, so rules (2), (3), and (4) do not apply. The change is specifically in the orientation of the cake piece itself.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the transformation from the left picture to the right picture at the top of the puzzle, the piece of cake with the strawberry on it rotates by approximately 90 degrees.

4. Confirm this by noticing the orientation of the cake’s layers and the strawberries' position in relation to the layers; the rotation is evident.
5. There's no indication of object rotation by 180 degrees since such rotation would result in the strawberries being on the bottom side of the transformed image, which is not the case.

Findings: The picture on the right shows the piece of cake having been rotated by 90 degrees relative to the position of the piece of cake on the left. Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top transformation, we see a figure of Spider-Man. The figure in the left image is standing upright, and in the right image, the figure is lying down horizontally.
- The change from standing to lying down is a rotation, and based on the images, it is a 90-degree rotation around an axis that extends from the head to the feet, causing the figure to go from a vertical to a horizontal position.
- Since the figure goes from standing to lying flat with its front facing upwards, this is consistent with a single quarter turn (90 degrees) rotation.
- Other transformations, such as rotations by 180 degrees or any other changes in size, color, or object count, do not apply here.

  - Option (A) shows a squirrel with slight changes in the angle of viewing but not a clear 90-degree rotation.
  - Option (B) features no change in orientation, only the perspective or the part of the squirrel that is visible has changed.
  - Option (C) clearly depicts a squirrel figure that has been rotated by 90 degrees from an upright position on the left to a horizontal position on the right.
- None of the transformations involve a change in color, size, or count of the objects.
- Therefore, the transformation in (C) is the same as the top transformation, with the object rotating by 90 degrees from left to right.",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The picture on the top shows a figure of Spider-Man. On the left, he is standing upright, while on the right, he is lying down, indicating a change in orientation.
- Looking at the changes purely from the perspective of orientation:
    - There is no change in the number of objects, as there is only one Spider-Man figure in both pictures.
    - There is no change in color, as the colors of the Spider-Man figure remain consistent between the two pictures.
    - There is no change at all between the two pictures regarding the presence or attributes of the object itself, only its orientation has changed.
- Thus, the rule that best matches the transformation seen in the top image is the change in the orientation of objects, which is (2).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top row, we see a transformation of a Spider-Man action figure.
- On the left, Spider-Man is standing upright, and on the right, he is upside down, implying a rotation has occurred.
- This rotation is precisely 180 degrees because the figure has been turned from standing on its feet to being upside down on its head.
- The rotation of the object is not 90 degrees because that would imply the figure would be on its side, which it is not.
- There is a change between the pictures; Spider-Man's position in space is different in the two images. Therefore, rule (3) does not apply.
- Rule (4) doesn't apply because there is clearly a specific transformation that has occurred between the two pictures.

Hence, the visual transformation of Spider-Man from the left to the right picture is best described by a 180-degree rotation, which is rule (1).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- In the top transformation, we already established that the Spider-Man figure undergoes a 180-degree rotation from standing upright to being upside down.
- Now we must find which transformation among (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom shows the same type of change:
    - Transformation (A) shows a squirrel figure moving from an upright position to being on its back, which does represent a rotation, but it looks more like a 90-degree rotation than a 180-degree rotation, as the orientation of the squirrel changes to horizontal.
    - Transformation (B) also shows the squirrel figure moving from upright to a position that is rotated by roughly 90 degrees, similar to (A).
    - Transformation (C) shows the squirrel figure moving from being upright to being upside down, which matches the 180-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.
- Transformation (C) precisely mimics the top transformation where Spider-Man is rotated by 180 degrees from an upright stance to an upside-down position. Thus, (C) is the correct transformation that matches the one we see at the top of the puzzle.",1,0,0
8,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(2) Orientation of objects

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the top images, we have a figure that resembles Spider-Man who is standing upright in the image on the left and is lying horizontally in the image on the right.
2. The number of figures remains the same; there is one Spider-Man figure in both images.
3. There is no change in color; the figure's colors remain consistent between the two images.
4. There is no change in size; the figure appears to be the same size in both images although its position has changed.
5. The primary difference is the orientation of the figure. In the left image, the figure is in a vertical standing position, and in the right image, the figure is in a horizontal lying position.

Based on these observations, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of objects, as no other aspects such as number, color, or size have changed.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Examine the figure on the top left, which depicts Spider-Man in an upright standing position.
2. Observe the figure on the top right, which shows Spider-Man in a prone, horizontal position.
3. The left-to-right transformation involves the figure rotating so that it is flipped upside down. This rotation is equivalent to 180 degrees.
4. A rotation of 90 degrees would leave the figure on its side, not completely inverted as shown in the top right image.
5. There is definitely a change between the two pictures, so rules (3) and (4) do not apply.

The transformation from the left picture to the right picture involves Spider-Man being rotated by 180 degrees, thus rule (1) is the correct description of the change.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Recall that the transformation at the top involves Spider-Man being rotated 180 degrees from a standing to a lying position.
2. Look at each of the three transformations of the squirrel object on the bottom to see which one matches this 180-degree rotation:
   - (A) shows the squirrel object rotating from facing right to facing left, while remaining upright.
   - (B) shows the squirrel object rotating and also slightly changing the angle of its orientation but not completing a full 180-degree flip.
   - (C) shows the squirrel object in one orientation and then flips it completely upside down in the next image, which is a 180-degree rotation.
3. Option (C) is the transformation that matches the top one because the squirrel object is in one orientation in the first image and is then flipped 180 degrees to an upside-down position in the second image, just as Spider-Man is on the top.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is (C), as it exhibits the same type of 180-degree rotation transformation seen in the top sequence with Spider-Man.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a cup with a coffee design. The image on the left shows the coffee cup from the top view, where we can see the design on the coffee surface.
2. The image on the right shows the coffee cup titled to its side, giving us a sideways view of the cup with the design on the surface partially visible.
3. There is no change in the color, number, or size of the coffee cup. The only change we observe is in the orientation of the object - the way the cup is positioned or shown.
4. Based on this single transformation, we can deduce that the rule describing this change is the orientation of the objects. Therefore, the answer is (1).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examining the top part of the visual puzzle, we notice that we have two images of the same coffee cup but from different perspectives.
2. The first image shows the coffee cup from a top view perspective where the inner design on the coffee is fully visible. 
3. The second image displays the coffee cup from a side view perspective where the top of the coffee is not directly visible and the handle is now in a different orientation relative to the viewer.
4. The orientation change from the top view to the side view typically involves a rotation of 90 degrees. There is no indication that the object has been rotated a full 180 degrees because such a rotation would show the bottom or the other side of the cup.
5. The rule that determines the transformation from the left picture to the right is that the object has been rotated by 90 degrees. Hence, the correct rule number is (2).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the top of the puzzle, we determined that the transformation involves a 90-degree rotation of the coffee cup from a top-down view to a side view.

2. Now, let's examine the bottom transformations one by one and compare them to the top transformation to find a matching pattern:

   - Option (A) shows a character right-side up in the first frame and then flipped upside-down in the second frame. This represents a rotation, but it is a 180-degree flip, not a 90-degree rotation. Therefore, (A) cannot be the matching transformation.
   
   - Option (B) presents a character facing forward in the first frame and then the same character rotated to show the side profile in the second frame. This change is consistent with a 90-degree rotation, similar to the top transformation of the cup.
   
   - Option (C) depicts a character facing forward in both frames without any rotation. There is no change in orientation, so (C) cannot be the matching transformation.

3. Based on the comparison, the transformation in (B) is the same as the top transformation, where the change involves a 90-degree rotation of the object. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",1,1,0
9,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(3) Orientation of objects

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top transformation, the coffee cup starts in an upright position and then is shown tilted to the side. This indicates a change in the orientation of the cup.
- There is no change in size, as both cups seem to be of the same dimensions.
- There is no change in color, as both instances of the coffee cup maintain the same color scheme.
- There is no change in the number of objects as we are still observing a single cup.
- Every other rule such as no change between the pictures or rules that don't apply is not relevant since we've identified that the orientation of the object is what changed. 

Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Observing the transformation of the coffee cup from the left image to the right image, we see that the cup is rotated sideways.
- Given that the cup is initially upright and then is seen from a side perspective, we can infer that it has been rotated approximately 90 degrees around its horizontal axis.
- A rotation of 180 degrees would have placed the cup upside-down, which is not observed here.
- There is indeed a change between the pictures, which rules out option (3), and since we've identified a specific type of change, option (4) doesn't apply.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the coffee cup at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top transformation, we observed that the coffee cup underwent a 90-degree rotation along its horizontal axis.
- Now we need to find which set of transformations among A, B, or C on the bottom demonstrates the same type of change.

Looking at each option:
- (A): This shows a cat-like figure that moves from facing front to lying on its back, which is a rotation, but this is a flip over its vertical axis, not a 90-degree rotation around the horizontal axis like the coffee cup.
- (B): This set shows two figures where there is no change in orientation or position. This does not match the transformation of the coffee cup.
- (C): The cat-like character goes from an upright position to a sideways position which is consistent with a 90-degree rotation around its horizontal axis. This matches the 90-degree rotation observed in the coffee cup transformation.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a coffee cup. On the left side, the cup is oriented such that the handle is on the right side. In the picture on the right, the cup has been rotated so that the handle is on the left side.

2. There is no change in the size, color, or number of the cup; only the orientation has been altered.

3. Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation of the object on top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, there is an image of a coffee cup on the left that is in a standard position with the handle to the right.

2. In the image on the right, the coffee cup has been rotated such that the handle, which was initially on the right, is now on the left. This indicates that the cup has been rotated halfway around its vertical axis.

3. A rotation that brings the handle from the right to the left requires a half-turn, which is equivalent to 180 degrees.

4. There is no 90-degree rotation because such a rotation would either put the cup on its side or flip it upside down, which is not the case here.

5. Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation of the object on top of the puzzle is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. We previously established that the transformation on the top of the puzzle is a rotation by 180 degrees.

2. Let's examine the transformations (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom of the puzzle:

   - (A) shows an animated character that seems to rotate, but not by 180 degrees; instead, the character is flipped onto the backside, showing us the reversal without a full 180-degree spin on a vertical axis.

   - (B) does not show a rotation but rather a sequential change where two identical characters are present side by side with no difference in their orientation.

   - (C) shows an animated character with a front and back view. From left to right, the character is rotated to reveal the opposite side, similar to the coffee cup on top.

3. The character in (C) has undergone a transformation that mirrors the coffee cup's 180-degree rotation, showing its direct opposite side.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We start by examining the top part of the visual puzzle, observing the object shown on the left and comparing it to the object shown on the right.
2. Initially, the object appears to be a side view of a piece of machinery or a tool, and when transformed into the right image, it becomes a front view of the same object. 
3. The change that occurs does not involve size, number, or color—these attributes remain constant.
4. What changes is the orientation of the object; it rotates from a side orientation to a front-on orientation.
5. Based on these observations, the rule that best describes the transformation is the change in orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observe the top part of the visual puzzle and consider the object in the left and right images.
2. Notice that the object initially shown in profile (from the side) in the left image has been rotated to show the front view in the right image.
3. Determine the degree of rotation required to achieve this transformation: The object has been rotated in such a way that the top of the left image becomes the front in the right image.
4. This type of rotation where the perspective shifts from the side to the front typically involves a quarter turn, which is a 90-degree rotation.
5. No other type of rotation or rule applies, as there are no 180-degree rotations or instances where there is no change or where this rule doesn't apply.
6. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Look at the top left-to-right transformation: the object rotates 90 degrees to change the orientation from a side view to a front view.
2. Now examine each of the three sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom to identify a matching transformation.

- In sequence (A), the airplane rotates around its center axis, changing the perspective but not in the same manner as the object rotation at the top. It's a horizontal plane rotation, not a vertical orientation shift.
- In sequence (B), the airplane also rotates, but this time the rotation changes the viewpoint from the bottom-facing view to a front-facing view, adapting a similar transformation to the top object—rotating by 90 degrees to shift the viewpoint.
- In sequence (C), although the airplane appears to rotate slightly, the main change is a color shift of the tail, which is a different transformation from the one presented at the top.

3. Based on these observations, sequence (B) matches the transformation observed at the top, as it involves a 90-degree rotation that changes the perspective in the same axis (vertical orientation shift) as the top of the puzzle.",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
- In the top transformation sequence, we see a handgun in two different orientations. The object on the left is viewed from an angle pointing to the left and slightly upwards, whereas the object on the right is viewed from the side, pointing upwards. There's no change in color, size, or number of objects.
- Since the transformation involves only a change in the orientation of the object, rule number (2) for ""Orientation of objects"" best describes the transformation depicted at the top of the puzzle.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
- Looking at the top transformation sequence, we can see that the handgun undergoes a rotation from the first image to the second.
- The handgun in the left image is oriented with the barrel pointing to the left and slightly up. In the right image, the handgun is oriented with the barrel pointing straight up.
- The change from the left to the right image is a quarter turn, which indicates a 90-degree rotation.
- Based on this observation, rule number (1) for ""Objects rotate by 90 degrees"" best describes the transformation of the handgun at the top of the puzzle.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
- We have previously established that the transformation on the top of the puzzle is an object rotating by 90 degrees.
- Now, looking at the sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom:
  - In option (A), the orientation of the plane doesn't change; it remains horizontal in both pictures.
  - In option (B), the plane also appears to maintain a consistent orientation; it's angled in both pictures.
  - In option (C), the plane rotates from a horizontal orientation in the first image to a vertical orientation in the second image.
- Similar to the transformation at the top, the plane in (C) appears to rotate 90 degrees from the first to the second image.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Firstly, we can see that the color of the object remains consistent between the left and right images in the transformation on top of the puzzle; hence, rule (3) about color doesn't apply.

2. There is no change in the size of the top object from the left to the right; therefore, rule (2) about the size of objects is not the rule that describes this transformation.

3. There is no change in the number of objects, so rule (4), implying no change, does not apply either since there is clearly a transformation occurring.

4. The change that occurs from left to right in the top transformation is the orientation of the object. In the left image, it is depicted from a side view, and in the right image, we see it from a top-down perspective.

5. The transformation from the left to the right image on top involves solely a change in the orientation of the object, fitting rule (1).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the images on the top of the puzzle, we see that the object in the left picture is shown from a side perspective.

2. In the right image, the object appears to have been rotated, and we now see it from a top-down perspective.

3. The change from a side view to a top-down view typically indicates a 90-degree rotation around a horizontal axis.

4. Since there is no indication of a 180-degree rotation, which would imply a flip to an upside-down or reverse side view, rule (1) does not apply.

5. There is clearly a change between the pictures; hence, rule (3) stating no change does not apply.

6. The object does not stay the same, and it does not rotate by any other angle that is specified by the provided rules; therefore, rule (4) does not apply.

7. Consequently, the correct rule describing this transformation is that the object rotates by 90 degrees, which is rule (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In option (A), the airplane's transformation shows a change in orientation, but the plane is being viewed from a different angle in the second image, which is not just a top-down perspective. It is a tilt-and-rotate combination and not just a rotation, so it does not match the transformation on top.

2. In option (B), the rotation is greater than 90 degrees since in the second image, the airplane appears inverted relative to the first image. This indicates a rotation of at least 180 degrees, making it different from the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.

3. For option (C), the first image shows the airplane from a side view, and the second image demonstrates a top-down perspective. This matches the transformation we see on top, where the object is rotated 90 degrees to go from a side view to a top-down view.

- In the top transformation, the left image shows a green top hat with its brim on the bottom and the crown on top. In the right image, the hat is shown from a top-down perspective, with the brim visible as a circular shape and the crown appearing as a smaller circle within it.
- Color and size remain constant, the number of hats is still one, and there is no additional change apart from the orientation.
- Therefore, the transformation that best describes the change from the left image to the right image on top is a change in the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top transformation, the hat in the left image is shown in a typical upright position with the brim at the bottom and the crown on top.
- In the right image, the hat is upside down, with the brim now at the top and the crown underneath.
- The hat has been flipped over its horizontal axis because the perspective has changed from a side view to what would be the under view if the hat were transparent, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation.
- The hat has not simply rotated by 90 degrees as we would still see part of the brim in view, and it's not a case of no change or an inapplicable rule.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation from the left image to the right image on top is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- We need to find a similar transformation among the three options provided at the bottom of the puzzle (A, B, or C).

Option (A):
- The shelves in the left image are facing right with the open part of the shelves facing the viewer.
- The shelves in the right image are still facing right, but they have rotated slightly, less than 180 degrees, since the open part of the shelves is now positioned upwards.

Option (B):
- The shelves in the left image are facing right with the open part of the shelves facing the viewer.
- The shelves in the right image are upside down relative to their position in the left image, which means they have undergone a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis.

Option (C):
- The shelves in the left image are facing right with the open part of the shelves facing the viewer.
- The shelves in the right image are also facing right but have shifted position slightly, and the angle of rotation appears to be less than 180 degrees.

- Out of options A, B, and C, only option B displays a 180-degree rotation that is the same as the transformation observed at the top of the puzzle with the hat. Options A and C show less than a 180-degree rotation.

1. Let's examine the transformation that occurs on the top of the puzzle with the two hats. The left image shows a green hat with its top facing up, while the right image shows the same hat turned on its side, with the top now facing the viewer.

2. We can see that other attributes such as the size, number, and color of the hat remain the same. There has been no increase or decrease in size, no new hats have been added or removed, and the color remains a consistent green.

3. From this observation, we can deduce that the only change occurring in the transformation from the left to the right image is the orientation of the hat.

4. Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of the objects, which corresponds to rule (1).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Comparing the top hat in the left image with the top hat in the right image, we notice that the orientation of the hat has changed.

2. In the left image, the hat is upright, and we can see the top of the hat. In the right image, the hat is rotated so that the top is now facing toward us, showing the interior of the hat.

3. This change in orientation from the top view to the interior facing the viewer suggests a rotation around the horizontal axis of the hat. 

4. The rotation appears to be a quarter turn, which corresponds to a 90-degree rotation.

5. Since no other transformations occurred—such as a 180-degree turn, no change, or other non-applicable transformation—the best description for the transformation is a rotation by 90 degrees.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is rule (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows a hat rotating 90 degrees to reveal its interior.

2. Now, looking at the three transformations on the bottom:

   - (A) shows an object rotating, but the rotation appears to be less than 90 degrees since we see the object's interior from a different angle compared to the hat's transformation.
   
   - (B) also shows an object rotating, but this object seems to rotate more than 90 degrees as we see an entirely different set of sides in the second image.
   
   - (C) shows an object rotating in a manner similar to the hat's transformation—a 90-degree rotation around a horizontal axis. Here we see the object's right side in the left image, and in the right image, we see the interior, similar to how we see the hat's top and then its interior.

3. Since the transformation in (C) closely matches the transformation on the top (a 90-degree rotation revealing a different face of the object), option (C) is the answer.",1,1,0

- The hat on the left is depicted in a regular position from a side-angle view, with the brim at the bottom, while the hat on the right is flipped upside down, standing on the top of the hat with the brim facing upwards.
- There are no changes in size, number, or color between the two images. Only the orientation has been altered.
- Since the only change observed is in the orientation of the top hat, rule (1) best describes the transformation that occurred.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

For the reasoning:
- Examining the top two images, which both depict the same green top hat, shows a clear change in orientation between the two pictures.
- The left image features the hat in a standard upright position, while the right image shows it rotated such that the top of the hat is now on the bottom, indicating it has been flipped over vertically.
- This type of transformation is consistent with a rotation of 180 degrees around a horizontal axis passing through the center of the hat.
- No other type of rotation (such as 90 degrees) would result in the brim of the hat ending up as the base and the top of the hat facing upward.
- There is no option suggesting that the hat has been rotated around a different axis, so we can infer that the rotation is around the axis that converts the upright position to the upside-down position observed.
- Rule (2) is the only rule that matches this observed transformation.","(C)

For the reasoning:
- The transformation at the top consists of the green top hat being rotated 180 degrees around a horizontal axis.
- We're looking for a similar transformation among the bottom three pairs of images, which all depict a piece of furniture (a cabinet with shelves).

Let's examine each option:
- (A) shows a slight change in perspective but does not flip the object upside. It seems like a slight rotation or tilting rather than a complete 180-degree flip.
- (B) displays the piece of furniture leaning sideways to the right, which constitutes a rotation but not a full 180-degree flip on a horizontal axis.
- (C) shows the piece of furniture completely flipped upside down, just like the top hat in the top transformation. This aligns with a rotation of 180 degrees around a horizontal axis.

2. The size of the walkie-talkie remains unchanged between the two images.

3. The color of the walkie-talkie also remains unchanged between the two images.

4. There is no change in the number of objects; there is only one walkie-talkie in both images.

So, the rule that best describes the transformation on top of the puzzle is a change in the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the top transformation, the walkie-talkie on the left is in an upright position with the antenna pointing upwards.

2. In the image on the right, the walkie-talkie is lying on its side with the antenna pointing to the right. This indicates that the object has rotated.

3. The rotation from the upright position to lying on its side typically represents a 90-degree turn.

4. Based on the position of the walkie-talkie before and after the transformation, it is clear that it has rotated by 90 degrees. There is no evidence of a full 180-degree rotation or no change.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows that the walkie-talkie rotates by 90 degrees as it moves from the left image to the right image.

2. Looking at the three transformations on the bottom:

   - (B) shows a cake viewed from the side in both images, with no obvious rotation between the two.
   - (C) shows a cake that has been rotated as well, and the transformation seems to match the 90-degree rotation of the object on the top. It goes from being viewed from the side to being atop view, which is consistent with a 90-degree rotation.

3. Without additional perspectives, it is challenging to precisely determine the angles of rotation in (A) and (C); however, (C) more clearly represents a 90-degree rotation that matches the type of transformation we observed at the top of the puzzle.

For the transformation on top, the object (which appears to be a walkie-talkie) rotates between the left image and the right image. The antenna that is pointing upwards in the left image is pointing to the right in the right image, indicating that the object has undergone a rotation around the vertical axis.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observation: The color of the walkie-talkie remains consistent between the two images, so rule (1) doesn't apply.
2. The number of objects in both images is the same, which means rule (3) does not apply.
3. There's no additional change other than the orientation, so rule (4) isn't applicable.
4. Rule (5) is a non-specific rule and doesn't apply as there is a specific rule that fits the transformation.
5. The apparent rotation of the walkie-talkie from an upright position to a sideways position clearly indicates that it's the orientation of the object that's changing. This makes rule (2) the correct answer.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

For the transformation on top, the object (which appears to be a walkie-talkie) rotates from an upright position to a position where the antenna is projecting horizontally to the right:

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The walkie-talkie on the left shows the antenna pointing up, which is the standard vertical orientation.
2. In the right image, the walkie-talkie's antenna points horizontally to the right, which indicates a rotation.
3. This change in orientation from up to right suggests a 90-degree rotation on the vertical axis.
4. There is no indication that the object has been rotated by 180 degrees, as that would result in the antenna pointing down or in the opposite direction of its original position.
5. There is clearly a change between the pictures, so rule (3) is not applicable.
6. Since a specific rule does apply, rule (4) is not applicable either.

The correct rule describing the transformation is that the object rotates by 90 degrees, hence the answer is (1).","(C)

To compare the bottom transformations to the top transformation, we concluded that the top transformation involved a 90-degree rotation of a walkie-talkie around its vertical axis.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In (A), we have pictures of a three-tiered cake. From left to right, the cake is shown at different angles, but it's not solely a rotation of 90 degrees. The orientation of the text on the cake changes more significantly than just a 90-degree turn, indicating a rotation of more than 90 degrees.

2. In (B), we again have the cake, but here it's clear that the transformation between the images involves a 180-degree rotation, as the text on the cake that was initially facing us is now completely reversed and facing away.

3. In (C), the cake rotates in a way that appears to match the transformation of the walkie-talkie. The text plaque on the top of the cake that is readable from the front in the first image is facing to the right in the second image, suggesting a 90-degree rotation around the vertical axis similar to the walkie-talkie's rotation.

None of the other options, (A) or (B), show a 90-degree rotation that matches the top transformation. Therefore, the transformation in (C) is the same as the transformation on the top of the puzzle, just applied to a different object (a cake).",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top row shows a single object (a walkie-talkie) whose transformation involves rotation. The object on the left is standing upright, while the object on the right is lying on its side, with the antenna pointing to the right.
- The color and size of the walkie-talkie remain consistent between the two images. There is no change in the number of objects, as only one object is present in both images.
- Therefore, the transformation that applies to the top images is a change in the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top row of the puzzle, we can see that the walkie-talkie on the left is standing upright. In the image on the right, the walkie-talkie has been rotated, and it is now lying on its side.
- This change of orientation from standing upright to lying on its side suggests a rotation of 90 degrees.
- The antenna of the walkie-talkie, which was pointing upward in the left image, is pointing to the right in the right image, which further indicates a quarter turn, or a 90-degree rotation.
- There are no other rotations (such as a 180-degree rotation) or changes depicted between the two images.
- Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

  - Option (B) displays a cake that is still upright but has been rotated horizontally by 180 degrees.
  - Option (C) illustrates a cake that has been rotated by 90 degrees, changing its orientation from facing forward to lying on its side, similar to the walkie-talkie rotation on top.

- The number of objects (1) remains the same.
- The color of the objects (2) does not change.
- There is a change between the two pictures, so (4) No change between pictures does not apply.
- Since the orientation is the only aspect that changes, rule (3) Orientation of objects is the correct answer.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Examining the transformation at the top of the puzzle, we see the object on the left is a rubber duck facing left, and the object on the right is the same duck now facing right.
- This change in orientation represents a rotation, and because the duck is now facing the opposite direction, we can infer that it has undergone a rotation of 180 degrees.
- There is no indication that the objects have rotated by only 90 degrees, as that would imply the duck is facing towards or away from us, which is not the case, effectively ruling out option (2).
- There is clearly a change between the two pictures, so option (3) No change between pictures is not correct.
- Since the rotation of 180 degrees is the applicable transformation, option (4) Doesn't apply is not applicable.
- Therefore, the correct answer describing the transformation of the duck is that it rotates by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation at the top of the puzzle involves the rubber duck rotating 180 degrees from facing left to facing right.
- We need to find which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom of the puzzle demonstrates the same 180-degree rotation.
- Looking closely:
  - Option (A) shows a figure turning upside-down, which is indeed a 180-degree rotation but around a horizontal axis, not in the plane of the image as is the case with the duck.
  - Option (B) depicts a figure before and after a 90-degree rotation, as it is facing towards us in the first image and to the right in the second.
  - Option (C) shows a figure facing forwards and then the same figure with its back to us, which indicates it has been rotated 180 degrees around a vertical axis, similar to the duck transformation at the top.
- Therefore, (C) is the transformation that matches the one at the top of the puzzle, where the subject is rotated by 180 degrees around a vertical axis.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the top row where the transformation occurs: we have a rubber duck followed by a squirrel.
2. Observe what remains consistent and what changes between the two images: Both the duck and the squirrel are singular objects — there is no change in the number of objects. Their sizes also appear consistent, and the colors remain the same.
3. Focus on what changes: The duck faces right while the squirrel faces left. The only difference between them is the direction they are oriented.
4. Compare to the rules provided and select the applicable rule: Since the change is in orientation only, the rule that best describes the transformation is about the orientation of objects.
5. Rule (1) corresponds to ""Orientation of objects,"" which is the correct rule that fits the transformation observed on the top row of the puzzle.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examine the top two images carefully: On the left, there is a rubber duck facing the right, and on the right, there is a squirrel facing the left.
2. Notice the direction each object is facing: The duck's beak points towards the right side, and when it changes to a squirrel, the squirrel's head (where the nose is) points towards the left side.
3. Determine the type of rotation if any: When comparing the orientation of the duck to that of the squirrel, it seems the animal has turned around to face the opposite direction completely, which is indicative of a 180-degree rotation.
4. Rule out other rotations: There isn't a 90-degree rotation because that would position the animals facing up or down.
5. Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which is Rule (1).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the transformation on top: As determined earlier, the top transformation involves the object (a rubber duck) rotating 180 degrees to become the other object (a squirrel), with the orientation changing from facing right to left.

2. Compare each bottom transformation with the top one:
   - Transformation (A) involves the object being flipped vertically, which is not the same as a 180-degree rotation.
   - Transformation (B) shows no rotation at all; the object remains facing the same direction, which is also not the transformation we're looking for.
   - Transformation (C) shows the figure initially facing right and then rotating to face left. This is the same type of orientation change as observed in the top transformation.

3. Since transformation (C) exhibits the same type of 180-degree rotation change in orientation from right to left, it is the transformation that matches the one on top of the puzzle.",1,0,1
13,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(1) Orientation of objects

To solve this visual puzzle, let's examine the transformation that occurs in the top pair of images:

- The object in the first (left) image is a rubber duck facing to the left.
- The object in the second (right) image is a squirrel facing to the right.

The change from the first to second image is the complete transformation of the object into something else, which includes a change in orientation. Since the rules provided in the task do not include a transformation into a completely different object, we must interpret the change in terms of the given options. The most fitting rule from the given list would be the change in orientation (the duck faces left, while the squirrel faces right).

Now, we need to see how this rule applies to the transformations in the bottom row marked (A), (B), and (C):

- Option (A) shows a figure facing forwards and then upside down.
- Option (B) shows the figure facing forwards in both images, with no change in orientation.
- Option (C) shows the figure facing forwards and then the figure doubled and placed into a vessel.

Among these options, (A) clearly demonstrates a change in orientation, aligning it with the top transformation's rule of change in orientation. Options (B) and (C) do not represent changes in orientation. Thus, the correct rule that best describes the transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To solve this puzzle, we will look at the transformation in the top row once more, but this time focusing on the degree of rotation:

- The object on the left is a rubber duck facing to the left.
- The object on the right is a squirrel also appearing to face left, or more precisely, it has been rotated to show its back side if we assume both objects are on a flat surface.

This indicates that between the two images, there is a rotation of 180 degrees – the duck is facing towards us, while the squirrel, if it follows the same orientation logic, is now showing us its back, which effectively means it has been 'flipped' to face away or turned upside down if considered in a three-dimensional space.

Let's verify this rule by looking at the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C):

- In option (A), the figure is rotated 180 degrees from standing upright to being upside down.
- Option (B) features no rotation; the figure remains oriented the same way in both images.
- Option (C) does not show a rotation but rather a multiplication of the figure, which is not relevant to the rule we are evaluating.

Option (A) confirms our rule – it shows an object (in this case, the figure) that has been rotated by 180 degrees, the same type of transformation observed in the top row. Therefore, (2) Objects rotate by","(A)

To determine which of the bottom transformations corresponds to the transformation on the top of the puzzle, we need to apply the rule we identified previously, which is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.

Now let's examine each of the bottom transformations one by one:

- Option (A) shows the figure initially facing forwards and then being upside down in the next image. This indicates a rotation of 180 degrees, which is in line with the transformation of the top objects, where the duck also undergoes a 180-degree rotation to transform into a squirrel facing the opposite direction.
- Option (B) shows no rotation or flip of the figure; it is the same orientation in both images, which does not match the top transformation.
- Option (C) does not involve a simple rotation or flip but rather shows the figure first alone and then contained within a vessel alongside a duplicate figure, which also does not correspond to the top transformation.

Since option (A) is the only transformation on the bottom that features a rotation by 180 degrees, it is the same transformation observed in the top row. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",1,0,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. By looking at the top set of images, we see the object (a sofa) undergoes a positional change from left to right.
2. In the first image, the sofa is upright and oriented such that we view it from above, slightly angled as if we were standing at the front and looking down at it.
3. In the second image, the sofa is leaned back so that the front is lifted up and the back is resting on the ground. We still view it as if standing at the front, but now the seating area is visible.
4. This transformation demonstrates a change in the orientation of the sofa in space, but does not show any change in size, number, or color.
5. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observing the top set of images, we can compare their orientation to determine the nature of the transformation.
2. The sofa in the left image is positioned upright and appears to be seen from an angle that is above and slightly in front of it.
3. The sofa in the right image has been rotated in such a way that the seat area, which was initially horizontal, is now vertical. The orientation change is equivalent to a quarter turn or 90 degrees along the axis running from the front to the back of the sofa.
4. The angle of view remains consistent in terms of the viewer's perspective, which supports the conclusion that the object itself has been physically rotated rather than the viewer moving around the object.
5. Since the sofa does not undergo a full 180-degree turn (which would have inverted it), the rule that best describes the transformation is a 90-degree rotation of the object.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Looking at the bottom set of images, we need to identify a transformation that matches the top transformation, which is a rotation of 90 degrees.
2. Set A shows a change in perspective or orientation but does not represent a 90-degree rotation; the object's top still faces upward in both frames.
3. Set B also shows a change in perspective or orientation, but again, there is no 90-degree rotation; the top of the object is still facing upward.
4. Set C shows a rotation of the object around its horizontal axis such that the top is now on the side in the second image, similar to how the sofa on the top turned its seating area to be vertical. This is a 90-degree rotation around the axis running from the head to the tail of the object.

To solve this visual puzzle, we analyze the transformation that occurs from the left image to the right image in the top row and then determine which of the given rules best describes that transformation.

First, let's examine the top row of the puzzle:

- The object in the top row is a gray, sectional couch. In the left image, the couch is oriented with one side longer than the other, while in the right image, the couch has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that the shorter side is now closer to the viewer.

Now, applying the given rules to see which one fits the transformation observed:

1) Number of objects: The number of couches does not change from the left to the right image.
2) Orientation of objects: The couch's orientation changes from the left to the right image.
3) Color of objects: The color of the couch does not change from the left to the right image.
4) No change between pictures: There is a change between the two pictures, so this rule does not apply.
5) Doesn't apply: We have already identified a rule that applies, so this option is not needed.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation for the couch from left to right in the top row of the puzzle is the orientation of objects, which is rule (2).","(1)

To solve the visual puzzle, let's focus on the top row where there is a transformation of a gray, sectional couch from the left image to the right image:

- In the left image, we see the couch with a longer section on the left and a shorter section on the right, positioned with the backrest horizontal to the viewer's perspective.
- In the right image, the couch has rotated such that the longer section is now at the bottom and the shorter section is on the top, with the backrest vertical to the viewer's perspective.

Now, we'll apply the given rules to this observation:

1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees: The transformation of the couch's position from the left to the right image appears to be a rotation by 90 degrees clockwise.
2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees: The couch does not appear to have been rotated by 180 degrees as that would have placed it upside down or in a mirror position, which is not the case.
3) No change between pictures: There is a clear change between the two pictures.
4) Doesn't apply: Since we have identified a rule that applies, this option is irrelevant.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the couch from the left image to the right image is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule (1).","(C)

Let's analyze the three transformations on the bottom of the puzzle (marked by (A), (B), and (C)) and compare them to the transformation on the top of the puzzle to see which one matches:

- Top Transformation: The gray, sectional couch rotates by 90 degrees clockwise from the left image to the right image.

Now, examining the bottom transformations:

- (A): The object, which looks like a multicolored children's toy, rotates about 90 degrees counterclockwise from the left to the middle image and then rotates back to its original orientation in the right image. This transformation includes a rotation, but it returns to the starting orientation, so it does not match the top transformation.
  
- (B): The object rotates by 90 degrees clockwise, the same as the top transformation. However, there is also a change in orientation because the object is now lying on its side in the right image rather than standing vertically as in both the left image and after the top transformation.
  
- (C): The object rotates by 90 degrees clockwise from the left to the right image, with the colors initially on top now on the side. This matches the rotation of the top transformation exactly, with no changes in orientation except for the 90-degree rotation.

Based on the analysis, the only transformation that matches the type of rotation seen in the top transformation without any additional changes, such as change of orientation or returning to original position, is (C).",1,1,0

- The bottom sequence marked (A) shows the same ice cream object in two frames with no change in its orientation or any other attributes.

- The first image of the couch shows it in an upright position. When comparing to the second image, it is noticeable that the couch has been rotated from its original position.
- The angle at which the couch has been rotated appears to be 90 degrees, as the side that was previously facing forward is now perpendicular to the viewer, indicating a quarter turn.
- This matches rule number 1, which states that objects rotate by 90 degrees. There is no indication of a complete 180-degree rotation or that there is no change between the pictures, and none of the other rules apply.","(B)

- When examining sequence (A), we see two images of the same ice cream with no rotation or change in orientation between them.
- In sequence (B), the ice cream is shown upright in the first frame and then on its side in the second frame, indicating a 90-degree rotation similar to the transformation of the couch at the top.
- Sequence (C) also shows the ice cream rotated on its side, but in addition to the rotation, it also appears to be partially buried or submerged, which adds an extra element to the transformation that was not present in the top transformation.

No other changes are observed; the number of roses remains the same, the size appears consistent, and the color is unchanged.
- The bottom transformations involve a wooden chair. Option (A) shows the same chair viewed from two different angles, with no other changes. Option (B) has the first chair oriented normally, but the second one appears to be falling over, which is an orientation change consistent with the rose. Finally, option (C) also displays an orientation change, with the second chair tipped to the side.
- Given the consistency across all transformations, including the sample at the top and the three options at the bottom, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation in the puzzle is the orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Looking at the top transformation featuring the rose, we see that the rose's orientation changes between the left and right images.
- In the left image, the rose is facing upward with a frontal view. In the right image, it has rotated around its stem so that we see it from the side, which indicates a 90-degree turn.
- The change is not a full 180-degree rotation because the front of the rose in the left image is not facing directly downward in the right image, which would have been the case with a 180-degree rotation.
- No other form of rotation or change is observed between the two images of the rose, so a 90-degree rotation is the most accurate description of the transformation.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the rose from the left to right image is that the object rotates by 90 degrees.","(B)

  a. Option (A) shows two pictures of the same chair from slightly different angles but does not display a rotation comparable to the one seen with the rose.
  
  b. Option (B) provides a clear rotation of the chair by approximately 90 degrees from an upright position to a sideways position. This mirrors the rotation seen in the rose's top transformation.
  
  c. Option (C) also shows a rotational change, but the chair rotates forward onto its side rather than rotating in place around the vertical axis similar to the top transformation.

3. A rotation from an upright position to its side is consistent with a 90-degree rotation around an axis.

   - In transformation (B), the chair on the left is upright, and the chair on the right has been rotated along a vertical axis to its side, maintaining its structure and not tipping over. This is consistent with a 90-degree rotation.
   - In transformation (C), just like (A), the chair on the left is upright, and the chair on the right has been toppled over in a similar manner, again more like a tumble.

2. In the right picture, the rose is rotated so that the flower is now on the right side, while the stem points to the left.

The transformation that has occurred from the left picture to the right picture on top is a change in the orientation of the rose. The size, number, and color of the rose remain the same.

2. In the second image, the rose is shown with the flower pointing to the right side and the stem to the left side, indicating a rotation.

The transformation illustrates that the rose on top has undergone a rotation. Since the flower has rotated from an up-down direction to a left-right orientation, this corresponds to a 90-degree rotation. The rotation isn't 180 degrees because that would have placed the flower pointing downward. There is obviously a change between pictures, so options (3) and (4) can be ruled out.

- The first image shows the figure (a small model of a person) upright and facing the viewer.
- The second image shows the figure lying down on its side, not upright.

Option (B):
- The first image shows the figure upright and facing the viewer.
- The second image shows the figure still upright and facing the viewer, with no change in orientation.

Option (C):
- The first image shows the figure upright and facing the viewer.
- The second image has the figure upside-down, with its head pointing downwards and legs upwards, mirroring the transformation seen with the animal in the top row.

The correct transformation that matches the top row is seen in option (C), where the figure is flipped upside-down, maintaining the original direction it is facing. Therefore, the rule that best","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The transformation seen in the top row of the visual puzzle involves the object (the animal) going through the following change:

- In the first image, the object is upright and facing to the left side of the frame.
- In the second image, the object has been rotated such that it is now upside down, with its legs pointing upwards and still facing the same direction (left side). 

This indicates the object has been rotated by 180 degrees around a horizontal axis passing through the center of the object, leading to an upside-down orientation while keeping the direction it faces (left side) unchanged. It is not a rotation in the plane of the image (which would typically involve a 90-degree rotation), but a flip over an axis. However, in the given context and the nature of the question, the closest matching option to describe this transformation is a 180-degree rotation, as the available rule options do not explicitly state the axis of rotation or distinguish between flips and rotations in 3D space.","(C)

To determine which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle, let's run through the transformations again:

Top of the puzzle transformation:
- The animal is flipped such that it is upside down in the right image compared to the left image. This is a rotation of 180 degrees along the horizontal axis.

Now, let's compare this transformation to the options given:

Option (A):
- The transformation is a rotation, but it's not 180 degrees. The figure is lying on its side in the second image, which looks like a 90-degree rotation rather than a full 180-degree flip.

Option (B):
- There is no transformation between the two pictures. The figure's orientation remains unchanged.

Option (C):
- The transformation here is a rotation of 180 degrees along a horizontal axis, similar to the transformation seen in the top row. The figure is standing upright in the first image, and in the second image, it is upside down with legs in the air and head pointing down.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) because it matches the transformation on the top, with both original and transformed states having undergone a 180-degree rotation about the horizontal axis.",1,0,0

The top row of the visual puzzle features a deer that goes through a transformation from the left picture to the right picture. As we observe the pictures, we note the following step-by-step:

- The number of deer does not change; it remains one.
- The size of the deer does not appear to have changed; it remains consistent.
- The color of the deer remains the same; there is no color change.
- The deer's orientation has changed; initially, it stands upright, and in the second image, it is flipped upside down.

Given these observations, the rule that best describes the top transformation is (3) Orientation of objects, as the deer's position is inverted from the first to the second image.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

In the top row of the visual puzzle, we have a deer that goes through a transformation from the first image to the second. Let's examine the transformation step by step:

- The deer in the first image is standing upright on its legs.
- In the second image, the deer has been rotated. Its legs are now in the air, and its back is facing down.
- This change in orientation is best described as a rotation of 180 degrees because the deer is now upside down relative to its initial position.

Therefore, the rule that best fits the transformation at the top of the puzzle is (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

To determine which of the three transformations on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation of the deer on the top of the puzzle, we need to compare the changes that occur in each set:

- (A) shows a figure facing the front in both the left and right images, implying no rotation occurred.
- (B) displays a figure that has rotated by 180 degrees from the left image to the right image; the figure starts upright and then appears upside down.
- (C) shows a figure that has been tilted to lie on its side, indicating a different type of rotation, not one by 180 degrees.

Since the top transformation of the puzzle involved the deer being rotated by 180 degrees, the transformation that matches this the most closely is (B), where the figure also rotates by 180 degrees.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top section of the visual puzzle, there is a transformation from the first image to the second image of the same object—a deer. 
2. The color remains consistent between the two images, eliminating the color change rule.
3. The size of the deer appears to be the same in both pictures, so size change isn't the rule applicable here. 
4. The number of objects does not change; there is still only one deer in the second image.
5. The deer's orientation, however, does change. The deer in the first image is standing normally on its four legs, while in the second image, the deer is flipped upside down with its legs in the air.
6. Since the only change observed is in the orientation, the correct rule that describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Review the top part of the visual puzzle again where the deer appears in a left-to-right transformation.
2. In the first image, the deer is standing with its legs on the ground, and in the second image, the deer is upside down with its legs in the air.
3. The orientation of the deer from the first to the second image has changed, suggesting a rotation has occurred.
4. The deer has not rotated by just 90 degrees because that would position it on its side, and in the second image, the deer is entirely upside-down.
5. Since the deer is upside-down in the second image, it indicates that the deer has completed a half-turn, which is a rotation of 180 degrees.
6. There is no evidence of any other types of changes between the two pictures, such as a change in position without rotation or an object remaining the same.
7. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We have established from the previous answer that the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is a rotation by 180 degrees (the deer is flipped upside down).

2. Now, we examine the three transformations on the bottom of the puzzle.

   - Option (A) shows a figure rotated 180 degrees from the first to the second image, similar to the deer's transformation.
   - Option (B) shows a figure that has been rotated but not by a full 180 degrees, as the figure's orientation is sideways in the second picture.
   - Option (C) presents no change in orientation or any other attribute between the two figures.

3. Since we are looking for a transformation that matches the top part of the puzzle, which involves a rotation by 180 degrees, only option (A) exhibits the same transformation.

4. The evidence leads to the conclusion that option (A) is the correct answer, as it is the only one that shows an object - the figure - being rotated 180 degrees from the first image to the second, matching the transformation observed with the deer on the top of the puzzle.",1,0,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Looking at the top transformation, the object appears to be a planet or asteroid with elements on its surface.
- In the left image, the object has a specific orientation with certain elements facing upwards.
- In the right image, the object is rotated. The elements that were facing up in the left image are now in a different position due to rotation.
- There is no change in the number of elements, their size, or their color.
- Therefore, the transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the initial position of distinctive elements on the object in the left image at the top of the puzzle.
2. Look for those same distinctive elements on the object in the right image to determine how much rotation has occurred.
3. The elements that were originally positioned at the top surface of the object appear to have moved to the side, indicating a quarter turn, which is a 90-degree rotation.
4. Based on this observation, the transformation between the two images does not appear to be a full 180-degree rotation.
5. Hence, the rule that the objects rotate by 90 degrees best describes the transformation.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall that the transformation at the top of the puzzle involved a 90-degree rotation of the object.
2. Now, examine each of the transformations (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle.

- For (A), the first image has the power drill in a vertical position and the second image has the drill in a horizontal position. This is a 90-degree rotation, but it is a single instance and does not match the transformation on top, which involved the object having multiple parts that rotated as a whole.
  
- For (B), the first image shows the power drill with the handle to the left, and the second image shows the drill flipped with the handle to the right. This suggests a 180-degree rotation or flipping, which does not match the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.

- For (C), the images show a progressive rotation. In the sequence of three images, the drill appears to rotate to its side from the initial position, somewhat akin to the transformation seen on the top where there is a continuation and progression of the rotation. While there is not an exact matching set of objects and rotations, it is the closest match, as it represents a series of rotations, and the last image suggests a 90-degree transition from the middle image, which aligns with the rotation seen in the top sequence.

The visual puzzle presented above features a top transformation where the orientation of the green object with orange leaves is altered from the left image to the right image. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left image on the top of the puzzle, the green object with orange leaves is oriented with a larger cluster of leaves pointing upwards and to the left.

2. In the right image on the top of the puzzle, the same object is rotated so that the larger cluster of leaves is now pointing upwards and to the right.

3. The color of the object remains unchanged between the two images.

4. The size of the object remains the same between the two images.

5. The number of distinct elements (in this case, components of the object like leaves or lobes) remains constant.

Thus, the rule that describes the transformation in the top part of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects, since that is the only aspect that changes from the left to the right image.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation in the top of the puzzle where the picture on the left transforms to the picture on the right involves the following step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the initial position on the left, the object's largest cluster of orange leaves is oriented towards the top left corner of the image.

2. In the image on the right, the object appears to have been rotated because the largest cluster of orange leaves now points towards the top right corner of the image.

3. The angle between the top left corner and the top right corner is 90 degrees. Therefore, the object must have been rotated by 90 degrees to achieve the positioning seen in the right image.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the object in the top section of the puzzle is that the object rotates by 90 degrees from the left image to the right image.","(C)

The transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the object. To find out which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches this, we need to look for a similar 90-degree rotation.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Transformation (A) shows an object that flips from facing right with the handle on the top in the left image to facing left with the handle on the bottom in the right image. This is a 180-degree rotation, not a 90-degree rotation.

2. Transformation (B) shows no change in the orientation of the object from left to right, so there is no rotation.

3. Transformation (C) shows an object that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The left image has the object's handle towards the bottom, and the right image has the object's handle pointing to the right.

The transformation seen in (C) matches the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",1,1,1

To solve this visual puzzle, let us start by comparing the transformation of the object on top (from left to right) and then compare it to the transformations of the objects labeled (A), (B), and (C).

On the top of the puzzle, we have two images of a group of objects – it appears to be a planet-like object with craters and several orange leaf-like objects on it. In the left image, the orange objects are clustered more towards the bottom right of the planet, whereas in the right image they are situated more towards the top left of the planet. This indicates a change in orientation of the objects relative to each other from the left image to the right image. The size, number, and color of the objects remain consistent between the two images.

Now, let's apply this observation to the bottom part of the puzzle:

(A) Shows a change in orientation. The drill faces to the left in the first image and upwards in the second image.
(B) Shows a change in orientation as well. The drill faces to the left in the first image and to the right in the second image.
(C) Shows no change in orientation, size, number, or color of the objects.

By using visual analogical reasoning, we can see that both transformations on the top and transformations (A) and (B) involve a change in the orientation of the objects. This suggests that the rule governing the transformation on the top is related to","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the objects in the top part of the puzzle:

- In the first image, the orientation of the cluster of orange objects appears to be towards the bottom right of the green planet-like object.
- In the second image, the cluster of orange objects is positioned towards the top left of the green planet-like object.

This indicates that the entire collection of objects has undergone a rotation. To determine the angle of rotation, we can examine the relative position of the orange objects to the surface features of the green object, such as the craters. By considering this, we can deduce that the objects have rotated by 90 degrees, as they have moved from one quadrant to the opposite quadrant.

The other options listed can be excluded as follows:
- (1) If the objects had rotated by 180 degrees, the orange objects would have been on the opposite side (top right or bottom left, respectively), but they moved from bottom right to top left, which suggests a 90-degree rotation, not 180.
- (3) There is clearly a change between the pictures as the orientation of the objects is different, so no change is not the correct rule.
- (4) A rule does apply—the objects have rotated—and it is specifically a 90-degree rotation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation on the top is a 90-degree rotation of the objects.","(C)

Let's review the top transformation and then examine each option on the bottom to determine which one matches:

Top transformation:
- The cluster of orange objects moves from one quadrant to the diametrically opposite one. This indicates a 90-degree rotation of the entire scene.

Bottom transformations:
(A) This transformation shows a power drill that has rotated 90 degrees from the first to the second image. However, it has rotated around a different axis (from facing left to facing up) compared to the top transformation (which rotated around a central point on the plane).
(B) This is also a 90-degree rotation, but it is around the axis of the handle of the drill, and it is rotated in a way that the drill faces the opposite direction (from facing left to facing right).
(C) At first glance, it seems to show no apparent rotation as the drill remains facing leftward in both images; however, upon closer inspection, we notice that the drill in the first image of the pair is tilted slightly upward while in the second image it's tilted slightly downward. This suggests a subtler rotation along the longitudinal axis of the drill.

The transformation we are looking for should be an in-plane rotation similar to what we see at the top. The transformation occurring in (C) is the only one that operates subtly in-plane, although less apparent and not at the same angle as the top transformation. Given the three choices, (C) most closely aligns with the in-plane rotation observed",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The top transformation features a single airplane and that airplane remains constant in number and size throughout the transition from the left image to the right image.
- The airplane's color also remains the same; no change in color is observed.
- However, the orientation of the airplane changes from the left image to the right image. Initially, it is oriented horizontally, and in the right image, it is oriented vertically, with the nose pointing upwards.
- Since orientation is the only aspect that has changed from left to right for the airplane, the best rule that describes this transformation is ""orientation of objects.""","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Comparing the left and right images at the top of the puzzle, we see that the airplane has been rotated.
- The airplane has not been rotated by 180 degrees because it is not upside down in the right image as compared to the left image.
- The change in the airplane's orientation from horizontal to vertical is indicative of a 90-degree rotation.
- Since there is no other change between the pictures, rule (3) ""No change between pictures"" does not apply, and rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is not relevant as there is a change.
- Therefore, the rotation of the airplane by 90 degrees accurately describes the transformation observed from the left to the right image.","(B)

- Observing option (A), we notice that the sneaker is rotated but does not display a full 90-degree rotation like the airplane at the top.
- Looking at option (B), we see that the sneaker is rotated from an upright position to lay on its side. This is a 90-degree rotation, which matches the transformation of the airplane at the top.
- Option (C) displays two sneakers side by side with no rotation, which does not match the single object 90-degree rotation observed at the top.

2. No change in color: Both images show the airplane in yellow, so the color has not changed.

3. No change in size: The size of the airplane appears consistent between the two images, indicating that size is not the aspect being altered.

4. No change in number: There is one airplane in both the left and right images.

5. The orientation is the only attribute that has changed: The transformation involves the airplane being flipped, changing its spatial orientation.

Thus, by examining these characteristics, we can conclude that the transformation rule governing the change from the left picture to the right picture at the top is the change in the orientation of the object.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the position of the airplane in the left image: The airplane is oriented with its nose pointing towards the left and slightly downwards.

2. Look at the position of the airplane in the right image: Here, the airplane has been rotated such that the nose is now pointing upwards and towards the right, which is a clear indication of a 180-degree rotation around its axis.

3. No 90-degree rotation is present: If the airplane had been rotated by only 90 degrees, then it would be either on its side or upside down, but still facing left or right. Since it is facing the opposite direction in the right image, we can disregard a 90-degree rotation.

4. No change in any other aspect: There is no change in color, size, or number of objects; the only change is in the orientation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the airplane from the first image to the second is a rotation by 180 degrees.","(B)

   - (A) shows a shoe that tilts to lie on its side from the first image to the second. It is not a 180-degree rotation but rather approximately a 90-degree rotation to the side.
   
   - (B) shows a shoe that appears to be flipped upside down from the first image to the second, indicating a rotation of 180 degrees.
   
   - (C) shows two identical pictures of a shoe, with no transformation occurring between the images.

- In the image on the top, the yellow plane changes orientation from the left image to the right image. Initially, the plane is upright and in the next image, it is upside down.
- This change involves rotating the object around an axis which alters its orientation, but everything else (size, color, number) remains constant.
- There's no change in terms of the number of objects (always one plane), no change in the color (the plane stays yellow), and no change in size (the plane appears to be the same size in both images). Only the orientation is affected.

- Looking at the top images, the plane in the left-side image is in an upright position, showing its right side and underbelly.
- In the right-side image, the plane has been flipped such that what was the bottom is now the top, and it's showing its left side in an upside-down position. This indicates that the plane has been rotated 180 degrees along the longitudinal axis.
- There are no other changes applied to the object; its size, color, and number remain unchanged, only its orientation is affected with a half-turn (180-degree rotation).

- (B) shows no rotation; the shoe is merely shown from another angle with the same side facing up.
- (C) shows a shoe rotated 180 degrees, much like the airplane. The left image has the shoe sole facing down and the top facing up. In the right image, the shoe is completely flipped over with the top now facing down and the sole facing up.

2. Since the elephant on the right is fragmented and the pieces are spread out in a pattern that suggests rotation as the main transformation from the left image, we can conclude that the transformation involves the orientation of the elephant. This observation doesn't have to do with the number, size, or color of the object, nor is there no change between the pictures.
3. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is related to orientation (rule 2).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observing the top part of the puzzle where the elephant is shown whole on the left and fragmented on the right, we focus on the orientation of the individual pieces in the right image.
2. The elephant's parts are not simply spread out; they are rotated in a way that the head and trunk, which originally pointed upward/left, are now pointing downward/right. This suggests an approximate 180-degree rotation.
3. The 180-degree rotation is evident by comparing the positions of the tusks and legs in the left and right images, noticing that what was once facing up and to the left is now down and to the right in the transformed pieces.

   - In transformation (C), the snowboarder on the left is facing down and towards the right, and the snowboarder on the right is upside-down compared to the left, indicating a 180-degree rotation.

- In the first image, there is a whole elephant facing to the left.
- In the second image, the elephant is shown in profile but appears to be cut in half, with the back half missing, and its orientation has changed to facing down.

The transformation involves a change in the orientation of the elephant from facing left to facing down, and also part of the elephant appears to be missing, but since the orientation change is the most drastic and evident alteration, we focus on the orientation for the rule.

Now, looking at the transformations on the bottom for validation of the rule:

- In option (A), the figure starts facing the top-left and then its orientation changes to facing the top-right.
- In option (B), the figure's orientation changes from facing top-right to facing down-right.
- In option (C), the figure's orientation changes from facing somewhat down-right to fully facing right.

All options (A), (B), and (C) have distinct orientation changes which align with the change observed in the transformation on top. Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation is indeed related to the orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the object on top again for this specific rule choice:

- The elephant in the first image is oriented facing to the left. 
- In the second image, the elephant has been rotated and is now facing down.

This transformation indicates that the elephant has undergone a rotation. Given that it has gone from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one, this suggests a 90-degree rotation.

Now let's look at the transformations on the bottom for comparison and confirmation:

- In option (A), the figure starts facing the top-left and then rotates to face the top-right. This shows a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- In option (B), the figure also rotates 90 degrees clockwise from top-right to down-right.
- In option (C), the figure rotates 90 degrees clockwise from down-right to facing fully right.

The transformations in all the bottom images exhibit rotations of 90 degrees, which is consistent with the observed transformation of the elephant image on top. Therefore, the rule that describes the transformation of the object on top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

Let's examine how the transformation on the top compares to each option on the bottom:

- Top Transformation: The elephant rotates 90 degrees clockwise from facing left to facing down. Note that although the elephant appears to be cut in half, the most significant change is the 90-degree rotation.

- Option (A): The snowboarder rotates but also changes position on the snowboard. This is more complex than just a simple rotation, and as such does not match the top transformation.

- Option (B): Here, we see a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the snowboarder, which matches the type of rotation observed with the elephant at the top. There are no additional transformations like a change in position on the snowboard.

- Option (C): The snowboarder also rotates 90 degrees clockwise, but additionally, there is also a slight movement to the left in terms of the snowboarder's position on the snowboard, which is an extra change not observed in the top transformation.

The only transformation on the bottom that matches the single rotation movement without additional transformations, as seen in the top transformation, is option (B).

This transformation reflects a change in the orientation of the object (the elephant). The color, number, and size of the object appear consistent between the two images; hence, the rule that describes this transformation is the orientation of objects.","(4) Doesn't apply

The transformation in the top of the puzzle does not involve a simple rotation of the elephant by 180 degrees or 90 degrees.

- A 180-degree rotation would suggest that the elephant would be upside down or facing the opposite direction, but the orientation would remain a side profile. This is not the case, as the second image shows the elephant from a top-down view.
- A 90-degree rotation would result in the elephant being viewed from either the front or back or directly from one side to the other in profile, but again, the view we have is from above.

Since neither a 180-degree nor a 90-degree rotation is reflected in these images, the only applicable rule from the options provided is that the rule doesn't apply; hence, the transformation appears to be a change from a side profile to a top-down view, which is not strictly a rotation of the object.","(C)

The left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle shows an elephant, and from the first image to the second, the perspective changes from a side view to a top-down view. This means we're looking for a transformation where the orientation changes from a side view to a top-down view without altering the color, size, or number of objects.

Now, examining the transformations at the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C):

- (A) shows two figures lying down, with the first facing up and the second facing down. This is a flip rather than a rotation to a top-down perspective.
- (B) shows two figures lying down, but the figure in the second image is rotated to show its front rather than its back, changing the orientation of the figure without converting to a top-down view.
- (C) depicts two figures, and the first is oriented with the side facing the viewer, while in the second image, we see the figure from a top-down perspective, just like the transformation of the elephant.

Therefore, the transformation in (C) matches the same type of perspective change as the transformation on the top, involving an alteration from a side view to a top-down view without changes in color, size, or number.",1,0,0

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation of the character from the left to the right on top of the puzzle:

- In the left picture, the character is standing upright.
- In the right picture, the character is now lying on its side, rotated approximately 90 degrees.

The change from the left to the right image involves only the orientation of the character. The character itself does not seem to change in size, color, or multiplicity; there is only one character in both images and the character appears to be the same size and color.

Based on this observation, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is:

(1) Orientation of objects","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

We'll analyze the transformation of the character at the top of the puzzle from the left image to the right image:

1. In the left image, the character is upright and facing the viewer.
2. In the right image, the character is now on its back, with its feet pointing upwards and its head pointing downwards relative to the original orientation.

This rotation appears to be approximately 90 degrees from a vertical/upright position to a horizontal/lying position.

The transformation does not involve a full 180-degree rotation, and there is clearly a change between the pictures; thus, options (1) and (3) can be ruled out. Since we can identify a specific change, option (4) doesn't apply either.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the top transformation of the puzzle is:

(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees","(C)

To determine which of the three left-to-right transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches the top transformation, let's compare each one with the transformation of the character at the top:

- Transformation (A) shows a snake on the left and right, with no apparent rotation or orientation change.
- Transformation (B) also shows a snake on the left and right, but this time the snake has rotated by approximately 180 degrees (flipped upside down).
- Transformation (C) presents a snake that has rotated around 90 degrees, changing from a vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation.

The transformation on the top of the puzzle involved rotating the character by approximately 90 degrees, similar to the change observed in (C), where the snake has gone from a vertical to horizontal orientation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top row, the image on the left displays a character standing upright.
- In the same row, the image on the right shows the character rotated, so it is now lying down flat.
- There is no change in the size, number, or color of the object, only the orientation changes from the left to the right.
- This observation is consistent with rule (1), where the orientation of objects is changed in the left-to-right transformation.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The image on the left in the top row shows a character standing upright.
- The image on the right in the top row shows the same character rotated, but this time the change between the images indicates a rotation of approximately 90 degrees because the character goes from standing to lying flat horizontally.
- This rotation does not appear to be 180 degrees as that would have the character upside down and in the same orientation plane as the original position.
- Rule (3) ""No change between pictures"" does not apply because there is a clear change in orientation.
- Rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is not relevant as there is a rule that applies which is the rotation.
- Therefore, rule (1) ""Objects rotate by 90 degrees"" is the correct rule describing the transformation from the picture on the left to the right in the top row of the puzzle.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top row, the character is rotated by 90 degrees from standing to lying flat horizontally.
- We are looking for a transformation in the bottom row where an object is rotated by 90 degrees.
- Option (A) shows a snake with its head tilting slightly different, but it's not a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (B) shows a similar tilt change as in (A), still not a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (C) shows a snake that has been rotated by 90 degrees from an upright position to lying flat horizontally.
- Therefore, the transformation in (C) on the bottom row matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle, which is a 90-degree rotation of the object.",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top row, we see a character (whom I will not name as specified in the guidelines) standing upright in the left image and the same character is lying down in the right image. Thus, there is an orientation change from upright to horizontal.

2. There is no change in the color of the character between the two images.
  
3. There is no change in the number of characters, as only one character is displayed in both images.

4. There is no change in the size of the character, as it appears to be the same size despite the orientation change.

5. Since the only change between the two images is the orientation of the character, the best rule that describes this transformation is the orientation of objects, which is rule number (2).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top row of the visual puzzle, the character on the left is standing upright, while the character on the right is lying on his back with feet in the air. This indicates that the character has been rotated around an axis.

2. The rotation is not by 90 degrees because the character is not depicted as facing forward or backward relative to the initial upright position.

3. The character has not remained in the same orientation, as there is a noticeable change from the first image to the second, ruling out rule number (3).

4. The change is not irrelevant or nonexistent, so rule number (4) does not apply.

5. The character has been rotated such that if the character were standing on a flat surface, it would now be upside down relative to its original position. This indicates a half-turn, equivalent to 180 degrees.

Therefore, the transformation where the character is turned from standing upright to lying on its back, with feet in the air, is best described by objects rotating by 180 degrees, which is rule number (1).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking for a transformation that involves the object being rotated by 180 degrees, we compare the changes in the top row to those in the bottom three options.

2. Option (A) shows the object (a snake) simply moving from the left to the right without any rotation. Therefore, option (A) does not match the transformation from the top of the puzzle.

3. Option (B) shows the object rotating such that the head of the snake, which is originally pointing up, ends up pointing down. This reflects a 180-degree rotation around a central axis. This matches the transformation observed on top where the character goes from standing upright to being upside-down.

4. Option (C) does not rotate the object at all; the snake moves from left to right in the same orientation.

Since option (B) is the one where the object undergoes a 180-degree rotation, it matches the top transformation and is the correct answer.",1,0,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation featuring a lion, we can see that the lion on the left is standing on all four feet in an upright position, and the lion on the right is in a flipped or rotated orientation where its belly is up and its back is down.

2. Across the transformation, the number of lions does not change (there is only one lion in both images), so rule (1) does not apply.

3. The color of the lion remains the same in both images, which means rule (3) does not apply.

4. Since there is a lion in both pictures, rule (4) for ""No change between pictures"" does not apply.

5. Because there is a clear change (the orientation of the lion), rule (5) also doesn't apply here.

From this analysis, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule (2).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the top transformation featuring the lion, the lion in the first image is standing upright on its legs.

2. In the second image of the lion, it appears to be flipped over such that if it were to be upright, its paws would be up in the air and its back on the ground, indicating a rotation of 180 degrees around its horizontal axis.

3. There is a clear change between the images as the orientation of the lion has been altered, so rule (3) does not apply.

4. Rule (1) does not apply because the lion has not been rotated by just 90 degrees. A 90-degree rotation would have the lion on its side, which we do not observe here.

5. Rule (4) doesn't apply as there is an obvious change between the two pictures.

Therefore, the transformation that best describes the change from the left to the right picture of the lion is a 180-degree rotation, corresponding to rule (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We have established that the top transformation of the lion involves a 180-degree rotation around its horizontal axis.

2. Now, let's analyse the bottom transformations:

   - For (A), the guitar is rotated, but it appears to be less than 180 degrees.
   - For (B), the guitar also seems to rotate but remains upright, so the rotation degree again is not 180.
   - For (C), the electric guitar changes to an acoustic guitar, and it is flipped such that the headstock and neck are pointing downward whereas before they were pointing upward. This represents a 180-degree rotational change.

3. Neither (A) nor (B) show a full 180-degree rotation, but (C) does exhibit this kind of rotation matching the transformation seen with the lion on top.

Therefore, the transformation marked by (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation of the lion at the top of the puzzle as both involve a 180-degree rotation.",1,0,0

The transformation from the left image to the right image of the lion involves a change in the orientation of the lion. In the left image, the lion is standing on all four legs in an upright position. In the right image, the lion has been rotated so that it appears to be in a playful or rolling position on its back. This involves a clockwise rotation when viewed from the front.

Now, let's look step-by-step at the reasoning:

1. The color of the lion does not change between the two images, so rule (2) is not applicable.
2. The number of lions remains the same; there is only one lion in both images, so rule (3) is not applicable.
3. There is a clear change between the two pictures; therefore, rule (4) is not applicable.
4. Rule (5) cannot apply since there is a noticeable transformation that has occurred.

Considering these observations, the most accurate rule for this transformation is the orientation of the object, which is rule (1).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The transformation of the lion from the left picture to the right picture involves a rotation. Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The lion is initially standing on all four legs in a natural upright position.
2. In the transformed picture on the right, the lion appears to be flipped over onto its back. This indicates that the lion has undergone a rotation along its longitudinal axis.
3. To achieve the pose of the lion in the right picture from the orientation in the left picture, the lion must have been rotated by approximately 180 degrees. A 90-degree rotation would have placed the lion on its side, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation from the left picture to the right picture is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule (1).","(C)

To determine which of the bottom transformations matches the top transformation of the lion, we will compare them step-by-step according to the rotation observed in the lion:

1. In option (A), the guitar transitions from a regular vertical position to a horizontal position with the headstock pointing down. This is a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise. This does not match the 180-degree rotation seen with the lion.
   
2. Option (B) shows a key transitioning from a vertical position with the teeth at the top to a horizontal position with the teeth pointing left. Like the guitar in (A), this is also a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise. This also does not match the 180-degree rotation seen with the lion.

3. Option (C) shows a guitar that flips around to face the opposite direction while still remaining upright. The back of the guitar is visible in the second image, indicating that it has been rotated 180 degrees. This matches the transformation of the lion, which also undergoes a 180-degree rotation while still in an upright orientation (relative to its own axis). 

Thus, the correct answer is (C) because it demonstrates the same type of rotation (180 degrees) observed in the transformation of the lion on the top of the puzzle.",1,0,0

First, let's examine the top sequence of transformations of the object, which in this case is a lion:
- In the first image, the lion is standing on all fours in its natural stance.
- In the second image, the lion is flipped over with its back on the ground and paws up in the air, signaling a change in orientation.

Now let's go through the rules:
- (1) Orientation of objects: This rule applies, as the transformation involves a change from a standing lion to a flipped-over lion.
- (2) Size of objects: There doesn't appear to be a change in size between the two images of the lion.
- (3) Color of objects: The color of the lion remains consistent between the two images.
- (4) No change between pictures: This is not applicable since there is a change, specifically in the orientation of the lion.
- (5) Doesn't apply: This is not applicable since rule 1 does apply.

Based on the transformation observed, the correct rule describing the change from the left picture to the right picture on the top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the lion in the top part of the puzzle step by step:
- Initially, the lion is standing normally on all fours, facing to the left side of the image.
- In the second image, the lion is not just on its back but also appears to be rotated such that if it were to stand up, it would be facing the right side of the image, which is opposite to its initial direction.

Now, let's go through the potential rules:
- (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees: This rule does not apply, as the lion seems to have gone through more than a 90-degree rotation; a 90-degree rotation would have placed the lion on its side, not on its back.
- (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees: This rule applies because the lion has been flipped over from an upright position to being on its back, which suggests a half-turn, or a 180-degree rotation.
- (3) No change between pictures: This is not applicable since there is an evident rotational change.
- (4) Doesn't apply: This is not applicable since rule 2 does indeed apply.

Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation from the left picture to the right picture on the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

To find the correct transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that matches the transformation at the top with the lion, we'll analyze each option (A), (B), and (C) step by step:

- (A) shows a guitar that rotates by 90 degrees to the right from the first image to the second image.
- (B) depicts a guitar that has been reduced in size from the first image to the second image but does not rotate.
- (C) features a guitar that has been flipped over 180 degrees (a half-turn) from the first to the second image, similar to what we observed with the lion on the top transformation.

Since we previously established that the lion on the top undergoes a 180-degree rotation (flips over onto its back), we're looking for a match with the same type of transformation.

Option (C) is the only one where the guitar is flipped over by 180 degrees, just like the lion was. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer as it shows the same type of transformation—a 180-degree rotation—as the one on the top with the lion. Options (A) and (B) do not match the transformation above since they involve different changes (a 90-degree rotation and a change in size, respectively).",1,0,0

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation, let's examine the visual puzzle step by step:

1. Looking at the top of the puzzle, we see a single object that is transforming from the left image to the right image. 
2. The object appears to be a folded circular paper or a fortune teller, also known as a cootie catcher.
3. We can first rule out ""Size of objects"" and ""Color of objects"" because there is no change in the size or color of the object from the left picture to the right picture.
4. No new objects are added, so ""Number of objects"" is also not the rule that is applied here.
5. As for the orientation, we can see that the originally flat-laid object on the left has been folded up or rotated to stand on one of its points in the image on the right.
6. Since ""Orientation of objects"" is the only visible change, rule (3) correctly describes the transformation for the object at the top of the puzzle, with no change in size, color, number, or any addition or subtraction of elements.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the top part of the puzzle to understand the transformation:

1. Focus on the object's position in the left and right images. The left image shows a flat, somewhat circular paper object, potentially a folded origami or cootie catcher.
2. In the transition from the left to the right image, this object has not only changed in orientation but the specific manner of the rotation suggests it has been turned to stand on a point that was previously horizontal. 
3. The object's edges in the left image become the points on which the object stands in the right image, which indicates a rotation.
4. The degree of rotation needed to achieve the position in the right image from the left image is 90 degrees. The object's primary flat surface faces upward in the first image and becomes vertical in the second image.
5. Since the object is rotated precisely in a way that its orientation is perpendicular to its original orientation, rule (1) accurately represents the transformation seen in the top part of the puzzle.","(C)

To compare the left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle with the transformations at the bottom marked by (A), (B), and (C), let's examine them one by one:

1. Transformation (A): The frog is rotating and its orientation changes, but it's more of a flip rather than a 90-degree rotation similar to the top transformation.
2. Transformation (B): The frog seems to be rolling onto its back which is more of a 180-degree rotation rather than the 90-degree rotation we're looking for.
3. Transformation (C): The frog is rotating in a way that resembles the rotation of the object at the top. The frog's orientation changes from facing left to facing upwards, which is a 90-degree rotation.

Upon reviewing transformations (A), (B), and (C), we can conclude that (C) best matches the transformation of the object at the top because both involve a 90-degree rotation. The frog in (C) goes from a horizontal position to a vertical one, similar to how the folded paper object at the top of the puzzle is rotated.",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top transformation from left to right, the shape of the object seems consistent, indicating that the size and number have not changed.
2. There is no change in color between the two objects, ruling out the color transformation.
3. The change that is evident is in the orientation. On the left, the object has a certain position, and on the right, it appears to have been rotated or flipped.
4. No other changes, such as additional objects being introduced or modification of the object itself beyond orientation, are visible.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the top images: the transformation from left to right does not show any change in the shape, size, or number of the object. This suggests the change is related to the object's orientation.
2. The left image of the object is oriented with what appears to be a 'split' facing upwards and to the right.
3. In the right image, the 'split' is now facing downwards and to the left, indicating that the object has been rotated.
4. The object does not reach the same orientation with a 90-degree rotation. However, a 180-degree rotation would flip the object into the orientation seen in the right image.
5. There are no intermediate positions shown, so this further supports a single flip or rotation, consistent with 180 degrees.

Considering this, the rule that the top transformation follows is that the object rotates 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know from the previous analysis that the rule describing the transformation on the top of the puzzle is a 180-degree rotation of the object.
2. Now we need to apply the same rule to each of the three sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle and determine which one exhibits the same type of transformation.

Sequence (A): The frog in the first and second images is in the same orientation. There is no rotation, so this sequence is not a match.

Sequence (B): The frog in the first and second images appears to have rotated, but the rotation is less than 180 degrees (considering the position of the legs and the eyes). This is not the same as a 180-degree rotation, so this sequence also does not match.

Sequence (C): The frog in the first image is oriented upright, and in the second image, it is upside down. This indicates a rotation of 180 degrees, which matches the same 180-degree rotation observed in the top transformation.

Therefore, the sequence that has the same transformation as the one on the top is (C).",1,0,0

In the transformation process shown on top of the visual puzzle, we observe that the object (which appears to be a fortune cookie) is transformed by a change in its orientation. The following are the step-by-step observations supporting this conclusion:

1. The color of the object remains unchanged.
2. The size of the object is consistent between the left and right images.
3. There is only one object in both the left and right images, so the number is unchanged.
4. The change that occurs from the left image to the right image is a rotation of the object around its vertical axis, resulting in a different orientation being displayed in the right image.

Hence, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

To determine the rotation that best describes the transformation on the top of the puzzle:

1. We see the same object in both the left and right pictures, which means there is no change in the number of objects.
2. The object's color and size appear to be consistent between the two pictures, so there's no change in these aspects as well.
3. The observable change is in the orientation of the object. To determine the degree of rotation, we look for identifiable features or asymmetries on the object.
4. The object's opening is facing up in the left image and down in the right image, indicating the object has been rotated half a turn around its horizontal axis.

Since a full turn is 360 degrees, half a turn corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

To solve this, we compare the transformation of the frogs in each sequence (A), (B), and (C) to the transformation of the object on the top:

1. In sequence (A), the frog is rotated, but it is also flipped onto its back, which is an additional transformation not observed in the object on top.
2. In sequence (B), there is no rotation of the frog; rather, the image seems to zoom in, focusing on a closer view of the frog's face. This is a change in the size or ""camera zoom,"" not a rotation.
3. In sequence (C), the frog undergoes a 180-degree rotation along its longitudinal axis, starting with the frog facing left and ending with the frog facing right.

The transformation in sequence (C) matches the transformation on the top of the puzzle, where the object is also rotated 180 degrees along a similar axis. Thus, the correct option that matches the top transformation is (C).",1,0,0

   - (B) shows a rotation that appears to be by 180 degrees, as the object has been flipped to lie horizontally in the opposite direction.
   - (C) shows the object rotating by 90 degrees from being upright to lying on its side.

3. Transformation (C) mirrors the top sequence, where the orientation of the object changes from vertical to horizontal through a rotation of 90 degrees.

For the transformation at the top of the puzzle, the camel in the left image is standing upright. In the right image, the camel has been rotated 90 degrees to the right and is now depicted laying on its side. This rotation aligns precisely with a quarter turn, which is 90 degrees. There isn't a 180-degree rotation because that would have the camel still in a vertical position but upside down. There are also changes between the pictures; thus, rule (3) does not apply, and rule (4) is not relevant since we can clearly define the transformation.

- Option (B) shows a flip of the object from standing position to standing mirrored on the vertical axis, not a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (C) displays two images that are the same, indicating no change in orientation. This does not involve a 90-degree rotation.

This means that the top of the camel has been flipped to where its bottom was, indicating a half-circle, or 180-degree, rotation. No mere 90-degree rotation would place the camel in the same upside-down orientation relative to the viewer; thus, rule (2) cannot describe the observed transformation. There is also a change between the pictures so rules (3) and (4) do not apply. Hence, the correct answer is (1) for a 180-degree rotation of the object.","(C)

The transformation on the top of the puzzle shows the camel undergoing a 180-degree rotation. To find a similar transformation among the options (A), (B), and (C), we need to identify which of them also exhibits a 180-degree rotation.

- (A) shows a hammer being laid down from an upright position. This is not a 180-degree rotation; it's more of a transition from standing to lying down.
- (B) doesn't show any rotation; both hammer images are in the same upright orientation.
- (C) exhibits a hammer that has been flipped upside down, just like the camel in the top sequence. This demonstrates a 180-degree rotation from the first position to the second.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C), as it shows the same type of transformation (a 180-degree rotation) that is seen in the transformation of the camel on top of the puzzle.",1,0,1

To solve this visual puzzle by determining the rule that best describes the transformation from left to right on top of the puzzle, let's follow these steps:

1. Examine the top part of the puzzle where the transformation occurs between the two images of a sofa.
2. Compare the first and second images:
   - The color of the sofa remains unchanged between the two images, so rule (1) doesn't apply.
   - The number of sofas is the same in both images, with only one present in each, eliminating rule (2).
   - The orientation of the sofa has changed. The sofa has been rotated onto its side from the first image to the second, which means rule (3) for orientation applies here.
   - Since there is a distinctive change between the pictures, rule (4) for no change does not apply.

Based on the observations, the correct rule is the one that describes a change in the orientation of the objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To solve this part of the visual puzzle, let's focus on the transformation that applies to the top images, which feature a sofa:

1. Observe the sofa in the left image and compare it to the sofa in the right image.
2. Notice that the orientation of the sofa changes from being upright to lying on its side between the two images.
3. Evaluate the angle of rotation necessary for this transformation to occur. The sofa has been rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by 90 degrees to move from an upright position to lying on its side.
4. This rotation demonstrates that the objects in the top images undergo a 90-degree rotation, which corresponds to rule (1).

Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation between the top images is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

To find out which of the transformations marked by (A), (B), or (C) matches the transformation on the top of the puzzle, let's analyze each one step by step:

1. Transformation (A): The gecko appears to tilt forward. This is not a 90-degree rotation around the axis that would place the object on its side, which is the change we observed in the transformation of the sofa.

2. Transformation (B): In this case, the gecko is flipped, possibly around its longitudinal axis, which would be akin to a 180-degree rotation. This does not match the 90-degree rotation seen in the sofa transformation on the top.

3. Transformation (C): Here, the gecko undergoes a change in orientation that is consistent with a 90-degree rotation, placing it on its side much like the sofa on top of the puzzle.

Hence, the bottom transformation that matches the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is (C), as it demonstrates a 90-degree rotation similar to the one the sofa experiences.",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning for my choice:
- The object on top is a couch, and it undergoes a transformation from the left image to the right image.
- In the left image, the couch is oriented with its seat facing downwards, whereas in the right image, the entire couch has been rotated and is now standing on one of its arms.
- There are no changes in the size, number, or color of the couch, nor is the couch identical in both images.
- The only change that is clearly visible is the orientation of the couch.
- Hence, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of the objects (1).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning for my choice:
- Observing the transformation of the couch from the left to the right:
  - The initial position of the couch has the seating surface facing down, towards the ground.
  - In the transformed image on the right, the couch is on its side, with the seating surface now facing to the left.
- This indicates that the couch has been rotated along a vertical axis that runs from the front to the back of the couch.
- The rotation appears to be a quarter turn, which equates to 90 degrees.
- There is no indication that the couch made a half-turn (180 degrees) as that would result in the seating surface facing up or the back of the couch facing down.
- The objects are not identical in both pictures, and there's clearly a change, so options (3) and (4) do not apply.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees (1).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning for my choice:
- The left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle shows a couch that has been rotated 90 degrees from a horizontal position to a vertical position.
- Option (A) shows a gecko that has flipped upside down but not rotated around the vertical axis, which is not similar to the rotation of the couch on the top.
- Option (B) shows a gecko that has been rotated 90 degrees from a horizontal position to a vertical position, which matches the type of rotation we see with the couch on the top.
- Option (C) shows a gecko that has been rotated by some degree around its long axis, which is a different type of rotation than what we observe with the transformation of the couch.
- Therefore, the transformation in option (B) best matches the same rotation as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle.",1,1,1

The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows a couch that is rotated between the left and the right images. In the first image, the couch is sitting upright in its typical use position. In the second image, the couch has been turned onto its back, indicating a change in orientation.

The rule describing the transformation is the change in the orientation of the object. The size, color, and number of the couch remain unchanged, and there is indeed a change between the pictures, so the only rule that fits is the change in orientation.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows a couch, and between the left and right images, it rotates. In the first image, the couch is in its normal position as it would be used for sitting. In the second image, the couch is flipped onto what appears to be its backside, with the sides extending vertically.

The rotation appears to be a quarter turn, which is 90 degrees. It is not a 180-degree rotation since that would result in the couch being upside down but still in the same plane as it began. There is definitely a change between the pictures, so rule (3) does not apply, and rule (4) is also not applicable because a clear transformation is observed. Therefore, the correct description of the transformation is a 90-degree rotation of the object.","(C)

We are looking for a transformation that matches a 90-degree rotation similar to the one observed with the couch in the top part of the image. 

- In (A), the left-to-right transformation shows the lizard being mirrored along its vertical axis, which does not match the transformation of the couch.
- In (B), the lizard rotates, but this appears to be a flip through its horizontal midline, resembling a 180-degree rotation (the lizard ends up upside down), which is not the transformation we observed with the couch.
- In (C), the lizard is shown undergoing a rotation from left to right, and in the final image, it appears to be on its side relative to the first image. This shows a 90-degree rotation similar to the couch's rotation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. When examining the top transformation of the object, which is a stroller, we can observe that the left and right images are identical in color, size, and number. Thus, rules (1) Color of objects, (2) Number of objects, and (4) No change between pictures are not applicable.

2. Careful inspection reveals that there is a change in the orientation of the stroller. In the left image, the stroller is pointing to the left, while in the right image, the stroller is pointing to the right.

3. Since the only change that occurs between the two images is the orientation of the stroller, we conclude that rule (3) Orientation of objects is the rule that best describes the transformation taking place in the top part of the puzzle.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top transformation, we see two images of a stroller. The color and structure of the stroller remain the same between the two images, ruling out any changes in color, structure, or number of objects.

2. The change that occurs is in the orientation of the stroller. In the first image, the handle of the stroller is on the left and the wheels are on the right. In the second image, the handle is on the right and the wheels are on the left.

3. The orientation change is exactly half a revolution, which means the object has been rotated by 180 degrees from the first image to the second.

4. We can therefore conclude that the rule describing the change is that the object rotates by 180 degrees. Hence, the correct rule is (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the transformation on the top, we've determined that the stroller rotates by 180 degrees from the left to the right image.

2. Now let's examine the transformations at the bottom:

   - For (A), the cap is flipped upside down from the left to the right image, which corresponds to a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis perpendicular to the viewing angle.
   
   - For (B), the cap is flipped front-to-back from the left to the right image. This is a rotation of 180 degrees around the vertical axis of the cap. This is the same type of 180-degree rotation observed in the top transformation of the stroller.
   
   - For (C), the cap rotates in place, but it does not complete a 180-degree rotation. It appears to be a 90-degree rotation around the cap's symmetry axis from front to back.

3. Given this analysis, the transformation that matches the stroller's 180-degree rotation is option (B), as it is the only transformation among the options that involves a complete 180-degree rotation, similar to the stroller transformation at the top of the puzzle.",1,0,0

In the top portion of the puzzle, we are looking at the left-to-right transformation of a baby stroller. When comparing the stroller on the left with the stroller on the right, it's clear that no change occurs to the color, size, or number of objects. What changes is the orientation: the stroller is rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise.

To illustrate step-by-step:
- The stroller on the left is positioned with the handle on the top and the wheels at the bottom.
- The stroller on the right features the handle on the right side and the wheels on the left, which suggests it has been rotated to the right from its original position. 

No other changes are noted, so the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the top portion of the puzzle, we are looking at the left-to-right transformation of a baby stroller. When comparing the two images of the stroller, it's clear that there is a rotation happening:

- In the first image, the handle of the stroller is on top and the wheels are on the bottom, which implies a certain orientation.
- In the second image, the handle of the stroller is on the right and the wheels are on the left side, indicating that the stroller has been rotated.

The rotation appears to be 90 degrees clockwise. There is no other change such as flipping (180-degree rotation), no new objects are introduced, and there is definitely a change between the pictures, so rules (2), (3), and (4) can be discounted.

To verify that it's a 90-degree rotation:
- The orientation of the wheels relative to the handle changes from vertical (top to bottom) in the first image to horizontal (left to right) in the second image.
- A 90-degree clockwise rotation would exactly result in the observed change of orientation.

Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation of the stroller from the left picture to the right picture is indeed objects rotating by 90 degrees.","(C)

To find which of the three left-to-right object transformations on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation that occurred at the top with the stroller, we need to compare each option and see which one involves a 90-degree rotation, which was established as the rule for the top transformation.

- Option (A) shows a baseball cap that rotates slightly between the first and second images, but the rotation is less than 90 degrees, and the cap is also flipped to show the underside in the second image.
- Option (B) also depicts the cap undergoing a slight rotation and a flip to show the underside, which is not a 90-degree rotation.
- Option (C), on the other hand, displays the cap in the first image with the brim facing left, and in the second image, the brim is facing down. This shows that the cap has undergone a 90-degree clockwise rotation, similar to the transformation of the stroller at the top.

Step-by-step reasoning for (C):
1. The orientation of the cap's brim changes from facing leftward in the first image to downward in the second image.
2. There is no flipping or other change; the only difference between the two images is the rotation.
3. The rotation is exactly 90 degrees clockwise, which matches the rotation we observed with the stroller on the top.

Therefore, (C) is the correct answer as it represents the same type of transformation, a 90-degree rotation",1,1,0

The top transformation depicts an object (a baby stroller) that rotates or flips from one image to the next. We can observe that the stroller changes its orientation from one picture to the next, where initially the stroller is facing left and then facing right. This change signifies a transformation solely in the orientation of the object.

None of the other transformations, such as a change in color, size, or number, or a lack of change, apply in this case because the only change between the two images is in the way the object is oriented. The color, size, and number of strollers remain consistent; the only change is in the direction the stroller is facing.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

In the top transformation of the puzzle, the object, which is a baby stroller, is rotated 180 degrees from its original position. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- The stroller in the first image is facing to the left with the handle directed to the left and wheels directed to the right.
- In the second image, the stroller is facing to the right, with the handle directed to the right and wheels directed to the left.
- This suggests that the stroller has been flipped entirely from one orientation to its exact opposite, which is a 180-degree rotation.
- This transformation does not involve a 90-degree rotation, as that would result in the stroller being either upside down or standing on its handle/wheels, nor is it a case of no change or an unrelated transformation.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

The transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle is the same as transformation (B) at the bottom of the puzzle. Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- The object in the top transition (the baby stroller) experiences a 180-degree rotation from the first image to the second image, changing its orientation from facing left to facing right.
- Looking at transformations (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle for a similar pattern of change, we see the following:
  - (A) The cap rotates but does not complete a 180-degree rotation; it appears to be turning less than 180 degrees, possibly around 90 degrees.
  - (B) The cap is rotated 180 degrees from the first image to the second image. It starts facing left and ends facing right, which matches the type of rotation we observed in the stroller transformation at the top.
  - (C) No change in orientation occurs between the two images; the cap remains facing in the same direction.

The top part of the puzzle shows a motorcycle that is oriented horizontally in the left picture and is then oriented vertically in the right picture. We are looking for the rule that best describes this transformation. The color, size, and number of objects remain constant between the two pictures; the only change is in the orientation.

Let's apply this observation step by step:
- We begin with the motorcycle in a standard, horizontal position.
- There is no change to the color, as both motorcycles are colored the same.
- There is no change to the size, as both motorcycles appear to be of the same size.
- There is no change to the number of objects, as we see only one motorcycle in both pictures.
- The change that occurs is in the orientation of the motorcycle; the bike on the right is standing up vertically.

Therefore, the rule describing the transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the transformation shown at the top of the puzzle:
- The motorcycle on the left is initially in a horizontal position, lying flat on the ground.
- The motorcycle on the right is shown standing on its back wheel, indicating it has been rotated.
- The rotation is not 180 degrees because that would have the motorcycle inverted but still in a horizontal plane.
- There is indeed a change between pictures, so the options (3) No change between pictures and (4) Doesn't apply are not correct.

The transformation involves a rotation along the vertical axis that appears to be 90 degrees. From a horizontal position lying on the ground, the motorcycle rotates to a vertical position standing on its back wheel. This change suggests that the rule applying to the transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

To match the transformation on the top of the puzzle with one of the transformations on the bottom, we need to look for a 90-degree rotation:

- In option (A), we can see the change from the first to the second picture is a rotation, but the snake character is laying down in the second picture, which indicates a rotation of approximately 180 degrees, not 90 degrees. Thus, option (A) is not the same transformation as the one on top.
- In option (B), the snake character rotates from a position lying flat on its belly to standing up on its tail, which is a rotation of 90 degrees. This option does match the transformation that occurred with the motorcycle on top of the puzzle, where it goes from lying flat to standing up vertically as well.
- In option (C), we see no rotation or any other type of transformation between the two pictures. The snake character remains in the same orientation and position.

3. Analyzing the lower row, the same rule applies: a dinosaur character is shown in an upright position in the first image of each pair, and in the second image of each pair, the character is shown in different orientations - either prone or rotated.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the top row of the puzzle, observe the position of the motorcycle in both the left and right pictures.
2. The motorcycle on the left is oriented upright, while the motorcycle on the right is upside down. This indicates the motorcycle has been rotated.
3. To go from an upright position to being completely upside down, a rotation of 180 degrees is necessary.

   - (B) shows a dinosaur that starts in an upright position and is then flipped vertically, appearing upside down in the second image, which is indicative of a 180-degree rotation.
   - (C) shows a dinosaur that has also been rotated, but this rotation shows a different orientation that does not appear to be a simple 180-degree flip.

2. By examining this change, we conclude that the transformation involves the orientation of the object while the color, number, and size of the motorcycle remain constant.

3. Looking at the choices (A), (B), and (C) in the bottom row, we can identify that they depict a similar type of transformation, involving changes in the orientation of the depicted character.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Observing the object on the left of the top row, we see the motorcycle oriented in a standard position.

2. Looking at the object on the right of the top row, we see the motorcycle has rotated. The change from the standard position to a wheelie position appears to be roughly a 180-degree rotation about the horizontal axis of the motorcycle.

3. Since the motorcycle on the left is upright and the one on the right is on its back wheel with the front wheel in the air, this is indicative of a rotation that aligns with flipping around the midpoint of the object's length, suggesting an approximate 180-degree rotation.

4. Based on this observation, the transformation described by the images at the top of the puzzle corresponds to rule number (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. We established from the previous analysis that the transformation at the top of the puzzle involves a 180-degree rotation about the horizontal axis of the motorcycle.

2. Now we need to examine the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to see which one matches this kind of rotation.

3. Looking at transformation (A), we see the character has not been flipped around a horizontal axis; there's just a simple repositioning of the arm, so it does not match.

4. Observing transformation (B), the character starts in a standing orientation and ends upside down, which implies a rotation of approximately 180 degrees around the horizontal axis, similar to the motorcycle's transformation on the top of the puzzle.

5. For transformation (C), the character is lying on its side in both images, so although there is a rotation, it is not about a horizontal axis in the way required to match the top transformation.

- We look at the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle from the left picture to the right picture. In this case, the object is an octopus.
- The color and size of the octopus remain consistent between the two pictures. There is no change in color or size.
- The number of octopuses does not change; there is only one in both the left and the right pictures.
- The only variable that changes is the orientation of the octopus. In the left picture, the octopus faces right with its tentacles flowing downward, while in the right picture, the octopus has been flipped so it faces left and its tentacles are flowing upwards.
- Since the transformation involves changing the orientation of the object, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of objects, which is rule number (1).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- In the top section of the puzzle, we observe the transformation between two images of an octopus.
- We can see that the two images of the octopus are not identical; there is a change in the orientation of the octopus between the two pictures.
- By comparing the positions of the octopus's eyes and tentacles, we can determine the nature of the rotation. The octopus in the right image appears to be upside down relative to the one on the left, indicating a rotation of 180 degrees. An additional indicator is that the octopus's tentacles that were pointing downwards in the left picture are now pointing upwards in the right picture.
- Since the octopus has been rotated in such a way that it appears upside down relative to its initial position, it aligns with a 180-degree rotation.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (2).","(B)

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- First, we know from the previous analysis that the transformation on the top of the puzzle involves rotating the object by 180 degrees.
- We now need to find which of the three sequences of transformations (A), (B), or (C) for the car at the bottom of the puzzle shows the same 180-degree rotation.
- Looking at (A), we see that the car only undergoes a change in orientation from the first to the second image, but it is not a 180-degree rotation as the car is still upright in both images.
- Looking at (C), the change from the first to the second image is a rotation, but it's a 90-degree rotation onto the car's side, not a 180-degree rotation.
- Now examining (B), we see that the car in the first image is upright, and in the second image, it is upside down, which indicates a 180-degree rotation, just like the octopus on top.
- As transformation (B) shows the same 180-degree rotation as observed in the top transformation, it matches the rotation type we're looking for.

2. The notable change that does occur is the orientation: the octopus rotates. In the left image, the octopus's head is upright, and by the right image, it has rotated to be upside down.

4. Therefore, the correct rule number is (3), indicating orientation changes.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. By examining the transformation of the octopus at the top of the puzzle, it's evident that the orientation of the octopus is changing between the two pictures.
2. To determine the degree of rotation, let's consider the starting position of the octopus. In the left image, the octopus is oriented with its head up. In the right image, the octopus is upside down, with its head at the bottom.
3. This change from head up to head down is a half-turn, which corresponds to a 180-degree rotation. The octopus does not appear to rotate by only 90 degrees because that would place it sideways, which is not the case observed here.
4. There is a clear change between pictures, so options (3) and (4) don't apply.
5. Hence, the correct description of the transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, making the correct rule number (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since we've established that the transformation of the top object (octopus) is a 180-degree rotation, we should look for the same type of transformation among the options on the bottom (the taxicabs).

2. Option (A) shows a taxicab that starts off upright and ends up on its side. This indicates a 90-degree rotation, which is not the same as the 180-degree rotation of the octopus.

3. Option (B) does not involve any rotation at all. The two images of the taxicab appear identical with no change in orientation, so this option does not match the transformation at the top.

4. Option (C) shows a taxicab that starts off upright and then is upside down in the second image. This is a clear 180-degree rotation, which is precisely the same transformation that is observed with the octopus at the top.

2. The difference between the left octopus and the right octopus is their orientation. The octopus on the left is facing upwards, while the octopus on the right is turned and facing to the side.
3. Since orientation is the only aspect that changes from left to right, rule number (3) for the orientation of objects best describes the transformation.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Examining the top row with the octopus, we observe the position of the octopus's head and tentacles in relation to the direction it is facing.
2. In the image on the left, the octopus's head is pointing upwards, and the tentacles are spread out below.
3. In the image on the right, the orientation of the octopus has changed such that the head is now pointing to the right, with the tentacles extending to the left.
4. This change in orientation from facing upwards to facing sideways corresponds to a rotation of 90 degrees.
5. Hence, the rule describing this transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We have already determined that the transformation of the octopus at the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation.
2. Let's examine the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle one by one:
   - Transformation (A) shows a car that remains in the same orientation from left to right, meaning no rotation has occurred.
   - Transformation (B) shows a car rotating, but it appears to rotate by more than 90 degrees as it goes from an upright position to being on its side.
   - Transformation (C) shows a car that rotates by what seems to be 90 degrees from an upright position to facing the right side.
3. Based on the observed transformations, option (C) best matches the rotation seen in the top transformation, which is a 90-degree rotation. Options (A) and (B) do not match this rotation; (A) has no rotation, and (B) has a different degree of rotation than required.
4. Thus, the correct answer is (C) because it features the same 90-degree rotation as the transformation at the top of the puzzle.",1,1,0

In the puzzle provided, the transformation occurring at the top involves a change in the orientation of the object. Let's analyze the visual clues step by step:

1. The object depicted at the top left is a red barn with a yellow roof.
2. In the subsequent image to the right, the same barn is shown but with a different orientation: it is rotated to show the side instead of the front.

Since the top transformation exclusively involves a change in orientation without alterations to color, size, or number of objects, the rule that best describes this transformation is rule number 1, which corresponds to the change in orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To explain step by step:

1. Looking at the barn in the top row, the first image shows the front of the barn.
2. The second image shows the side of the barn.

Between these two images, the barn has been rotated to show a different face of the 3D object. The front view switches to the side view, indicating a 90-degree rotation, either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on your perspective. A 180-degree rotation would have shown either the back of the barn or an upside-down front. Since the original front view is no longer visible and a new side is shown, the barn has been rotated by 90 degrees as per the provided options.","(C)

The top transformation involves a 90-degree rotation of the object, as previously identified. Let's analyze the three transformations at the bottom to match this type of change:

- In (A), the same figure is displayed in two images with no change in orientation or any other features, so this does not match the 90-degree rotation rule.
- In (B), the figure rotates, but the rotation is 180 degrees since the figure's feet, which initially point to the left, are pointing to the right in the second image. This is not a 90-degree rotation.
- In (C), the figure rotates by 90 degrees as it goes from being upright in the first image to lying on its back in the second image.

Only transformation (C) matches the 90-degree rotation seen in the transformation on the top. The character's orientation has changed as if it has been rotated along the horizontal axis by 90 degrees, akin to the top puzzle where the barn has been rotated by 90 degrees to show a different side.",1,1,0

To determine the rule that describes the transformation of the object at the top (the barn), let's examine the images step-by-step:

1. The object on the left is a barn facing front.
2. The object on the right is the same barn but rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise and also it seems to be slightly tilted away.

The barn does not change color, size, or quantity. There is no scenario where there is no change between pictures, and all other rules do not seem to apply. So, the rule that best describes the transformation of the barn is the change in the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To determine the rule that describes the transformation of the object at the top (the barn), let's perform a step-by-step analysis:

1. The object on the left is a front-facing barn.
2. The object on the right appears to have rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise from the front-facing position.

Considering these observations, the barn undergoes a rotation that best fits a 90-degree turn. There is no 180-degree rotation, no scenario where there is no change between pictures, and none of the other rules would apply here. Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation on top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

To match the transformation at the top of the puzzle with one of the three transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom, we need to find the one that mirrors a 90-degree rotation:

1. Transformation (A) shows an object flipping upside-down, which is a 180-degree rotation, not matching the top transformation of 90 degrees.
2. Transformation (B) shows no rotation but a side-to-side mirror effect, which is also not a 90-degree rotation.
3. Transformation (C) shows the object rotating approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, matching the transformation of the barn on top. 

Thus, the transformation in the bottom row that exhibits the same rule as the top transformation is (C), where the object is rotated by approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise.",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top part of the puzzle, we have two images of a barn or house.
- The first image shows the house facing front, while the second image depicts the house rotated approximately 90 degrees to the right, so we see its side.
- Since the only change between the two pictures is the orientation of the house, the correct rule that applies to the transformation on top of the puzzle is the Orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top part of the puzzle, we observe a house in two different states.
- In the first picture, the house is oriented such that the front is facing the viewer.
- In the second picture, the house is rotated so that we see its side, which indicates a 90-degree turn to the right.
- There is no other change between the pictures except for the rotation.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We previously determined that the transformation on the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the house.
- Now, let's look at each of the three left-to-right transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C) to identify a similar 90-degree rotation.

(A) Transformation:
- The character in the first image is upright, and in the second image, the character is rotated onto its back. This is a rotation, but it is a 180-degree rotation, not 90 degrees.

(B) Transformation:
- The character in the first image is upright, and in the second image, the character is rotated 90 degrees to the right, now facing the left of the viewer. This matches the 90-degree rotation we observed in the top transformation.

(C) Transformation:
- The character is upright in both images, with no rotation applied between the first and the second images. Therefore, this does not match the transformation on top.

The transformation that matches the one on the top is (B) since it is the only set that shows a 90-degree rotation of the character, similar to the 90-degree rotation of the house in the top transformation.",1,1,1

The transformation occurring at the top of the puzzle is related to the orientation of the bike object. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The color of the bike does not change; it remains the same shade of red in both the left and the right images.
2. The size of the bike remains consistent; there's no apparent increase or decrease in size from left to right.
3. There's no addition or subtraction of any bike; only one bike is present in both the left and the right images.
4. The change is in the orientation—on the left, the bike is upright, in a typical riding position. On the right, the bike is flipped upside down, suggesting that the rule governing the transformation is related to the orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The transformation occurring at the top of the puzzle shows the bike rotating. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left image, the bike is upright, in a standard, rideable position.
2. In the right image, the bike is upside down, which would be the result of a 180-degree rotation along the axis that runs from the front to the back of the bicycle.
3. The rotation is not by 90 degrees, because if it were, the bike would be on its side, either to the left or right.
4. There are no multiple rotations, just a single flip which indicates a single 180-degree rotation.
5. Clearly, there's a change between the pictures, so rule (3) does not apply.
6. Since a specific rotation is observed, rule (4) does not apply because a rule does apply - specifically, the 180-degree rotation.","(C)

Let's analyze the transformations for each pair of objects on the bottom of the puzzle to determine which one matches the transformation of the bike at the top:

(A) The object on the left is a teapot with its handle oriented on the right side, spout on the left. On the right, the teapot is larger and the handle is on the left with the spout on the right. This shows a change in size and orientation, but it is not a 180-degree rotation, as it was with the bike.

(B) The teapot on the left has its handle on the right and the spout on the left. On the right, the teapot is smaller and the handle remains on the right with the spout on the left. This indicates a change in size but not an orientation, and therefore not a 180-degree rotation.

(C) The teapot on the left has its handle on the right and the spout on the left. In the right image, the teapot has been flipped so that the handle is now on the left and the spout is on the right, which matches a 180-degree rotation analogous to the transformation of the bike in the top sequence.

Therefore, the answer is (C) because in both cases at the top and bottom of the puzzle, the objects undergo a 180-degree rotation along the axis that runs from the front to the back of the object.",1,0,0

3. In the right image, the bicycle is flipped upside down, which would happen if it were rotated 180 degrees around a horizontal axis going through the center of the bike.
4. The change from the left to the right image does not suggest a 90-degree rotation as that would put the bicycle on its side, nor is there no change between the pictures.

2. We can see that the bicycle on the left is upright and the bicycle on the right is turned upside down. 
3. This change indicates that the orientation of the bicycle has been altered from the first image to the second.
4. The number of bicycles remains the same, the color does not change, and there is a clear change between the pictures, so the rules about number, color, and no change can be disregarded.

2. The bicycle in the left picture is in an upright position, while in the right picture, the bicycle is upside down.
3. This change in orientation shows that the bicycle has been rotated. To go from upright to upside down, the bicycle must have been rotated by 180 degrees.
4. There is no indication that the rotation is only by 90 degrees, as this would leave the bicycle on its side, which is not the case. Also, there is a clear change between the pictures, so there is no rule of 'no change between pictures' applicable.

- The object on the right is positioned with the shorter end facing downwards, and the longer side inclined towards the viewer, indicating a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis from the original position.
- The main change in the transformation is the orientation of the object, as there are no changes in size, number, or color.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is the change in orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Inspecting the transformation on the top, we see the same silver kitchen utensil in two different orientations.
- On the left, the utensil's longer end slants away from the viewpoint, with the shorter end up.
- On the right, the utensil's orientation has been flipped so that the longer end now slants towards the viewpoint, with the shorter end down.
- This indicates a rotation along the horizontal axis. The utensil has not been turned 90 degrees because such a turn would imply a different final orientation, such as standing on its side or end, which is not the case here.
- Instead, the utensil has been turned upside down, which is a rotation of 180 degrees.
- Given this information, the correct rule describing the transformation is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

- Now let's analyze the transformations at the bottom marked as (A), (B), and (C).

For transformation (A):
- The flower on the left is upright.
- The flower in the middle is tilted to the left, which implies some degree of rotation but not a full 180 degrees.

- The flower on the left is upright.
- The flower in the middle is also upright, showing no rotation at all.

For transformation (C):
- The flower on the left is upright.
- The flower in the middle is flipped upside down, which indicates a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis, similar to the object on top.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the choice:

1. The first image on the top row shows a cheese grater upright with its handle on the top.
2. The second image on the top row shows the same cheese grater flipped upside down, with the handle now on the bottom.

Since the cheese grater remains the same in color, number, and size - and there is no ""no change"" scenario - the only transformation that occurs is the orientation of the object. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of objects.","(2)

To analyze the transformation in the top of the puzzle for the cheese graters:

1. In the first image, the cheese grater is oriented upright with its handle at the top and the grating surface facing the viewer.
2. In the second image, the cheese grater appears to have been rotated so that the handle is now at the bottom, indicating a rotation of 180 degrees.

No other transformations, such as 90-degree rotation or no change, apply here since a 180-degree rotation is clearly observed. Thus, the correct rule to describe this specific transformation is that objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

The transformation of the cheese grater on the top of the puzzle is a rotation of 180 degrees from left to right. So, we are looking for a similar 180-degree rotation among the picture sets labeled (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom.

Let's analyze each bottom transformation:

- (A) shows two flowers in the same orientation, so there is no rotation or any other change.
- (B) shows a flower that has been rotated 180 degrees from the first image to the second image; the flower petals that were pointing up are now facing down, matching the rotation seen with the cheese grater.
- (C) shows a change in both the number of flower petals and the number of leaves. This does not match the rotation observed in the top transformation.

4. There is no change in size as the object appears to be the same size in both images.
5. The only change observed is in the orientation of the object. In the first image, the object is upright, and in the second image, the object is flipped upside down.

3. Observe the orientation of the object from the first image to the second image. The object is rotated horizontally but is still facing the same direction vertically, indicating a rotation around the longitudinal axis.

   - For (A), the flower appears to remain in the same orientation and position between the first and second images, so there is no rotation.
   - For (B), the flower rotates, but instead of rotating 180 degrees, it seems to have rotated 90 degrees because the orientation changes from facing upright to facing to the right.
   - For (C), the flower undergoes a transformation where the first image shows the flower facing upright, and the second image shows the flower upside down, implying a 180-degree rotation.

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's observe the changes from the picture on the left to the picture on the right:

1. The number of objects remains the same; there is one rabbit in both pictures. This means that rule (1) does not apply.
2. The orientation of the object changes. The rabbit on the left is standing on a base and facing forward, while the rabbit on the right is lying down with its legs extended upward, which is a significant change in orientation. This change follows rule (2).
3. The size of the objects does not appear to change. The rabbit remains consistent in size from left to right, so rule (3) does not apply.
4. There is an evident change between the two pictures, so rule (4) is not applicable.

Considering these observations, the rule that best describes the transformation on top is the orientation of the object, which is rule (2).","(1)

To determine which rule describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's analyze the rotation of the rabbit from the left picture to the right picture:

1. Observing the rabbit's position, we notice that it has been rotated. In the left picture, the rabbit is sitting upright on its bottom, while in the right picture, the rabbit is flipped over with its legs in the air. This indicates a rotation has occurred.
2. To determine the degree of rotation, we compare the orientation of the rabbit's features. A rotation of 180 degrees would place the rabbit's features opposite of where they started, which is what we see here: the upright rabbit has been flipped to a position with its legs up and head down.

Consequently, the transformation that occurred is a rotation by 180 degrees, aligning with rule (1). There is no 90-degree rotation present, and since there is a rotation, rules (3) ""No change between pictures"" and (4) ""Doesn't apply"" are not relevant here.

Therefore, the correct rule number describing the transformation on top is (1), indicating a rotation of 180 degrees.","(C)

Let's compare the left-to-right transformations of each pair of images in (A), (B), and (C) with the top transformation to find a match:

(B) - The first object here is also upright, and the second object is a mirror image but remains upright. This is not a rotation, so it does not match the top transformation either.
(C) - The first object is upright, and the second object has been flipped over, which corresponds to a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis. This is the same type of transformation that occurred with the rabbit at the top.

   - Option (A) shows the ice cream sundae turning from a frontal view to a side view. This appears to be less than a 180-degree rotation and likely represents a 90-degree rotation on its vertical axis.
   
   - Option (B) also shows the ice cream sundae turning, with the second image being the reverse of the first, indicating that the sundae has been rotated by 180 degrees. However, additionally, there seems to be a change in perspective as the second image appears slightly smaller suggesting some tilting or perspective shift may have occurred.
   
   - Option (C) shows the ice cream sundae again, but this time the second image is a mirror reflection of the sundae, which indicates a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis, just like the rabbit on top.

- Since the rooster is not in the same orientation in both pictures, rule (3) does not apply.
- There is a change in the transformation, so rule (4) does not apply.
- As the rotation is exactly half a full turn, the correct description of this transformation is a rotation by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation on the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the rooster around its vertical axis.
- To find a matching transformation at the bottom:

  (A) The first and second images of the cat depict no rotation but rather a subtle change in the cat's size and position within the frame.
  
  (B) The first and second images of the cat show a rotation, but the cat is rotated less than 180 degrees. It seems to be around a 90-degree rotation as the side view transitions to a view of the cat facing the observer.
  
  (C) The cat shown here is displayed in an upright position in the first image and then appears upside down in the second image, which indicates a rotation around its horizontal axis by 180 degrees.

- Since (C) is the only option that shows a 180-degree rotation (though around a different axis compared to the top transformation), it is the correct answer that matches the kind of transformation seen at the top. Options (A) and (B) show different types of transformations that are not 180-degree rotations.",1,0,0
32,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(2) Orientation of objects

In the transformation sequence at the top of the puzzle, we can see a single object, a rooster, changing its orientation from the left picture to the right picture. In the left picture, the rooster is facing left, and in the right picture, the rooster is facing right. There is no change in the number of objects, the color of the object, nor does it appear to remain unchanged; therefore, the rule that best describes the top transformation is the orientation of the object. Now, let's examine the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) for the bottom images:

- In (A), the cat goes from a standing position to a tumbling or falling position, indicating a change in orientation.
- In (B), the change is again in the orientation; the cat goes from standing on its feet to lying on its back.
- In (C), the cat's orientation remains the same, with the direction of the cat's head perhaps slightly more to one side in the right image, but overall the cat is still upright in both pictures.

The sequence that best matches the transformation seen at the top with the rooster, based on the orientation change, is either (A) or (B), as both feature a significant change in the orientation of the cat. However, between (A) and (B), the change in (B) is more consistent with the top transformation, as the cat in (B","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

In the top transformation of the puzzle, we observe that the rooster rotates from facing left to facing right. This suggests that the rooster has undergone a rotation, and by comparing the two pictures, we can conclude that this rotation is approximately 180 degrees because the rooster is facing the opposite direction in the second image.

Let's follow the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Look at the rooster in the left image; it is facing toward the left side of the picture.
2. Look at the rooster in the right image; it is facing toward the right side of the picture.
3. The change in orientation from the left image to the right image is such that the rooster has turned around completely, which is indicative of a 180-degree rotation.
4. There are no other changes in the color, number, or size of the object, and it's clear that a 90-degree rotation (rule 1) would not result in the rooster facing the opposite direction. Similarly, rule 3 (no change between pictures) does not apply since there is a noticeable change, and rule 4 (doesn't apply) is not relevant to this specific change.

Therefore, the correct rule that describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is (2), indicating that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(B)

To determine which of the three options (A), (B), or (C) has the same transformation as the top of the puzzle, we need to compare the orientation changes in each sequence. The top transformation involves the rooster rotating by 180 degrees, changing from facing left to facing right.

Now let's examine the transformations (A), (B), and (C):

- (A) shows a cat going from standing to tumbling/falling. While the cat's orientation changes, it is not a clear rotation of 180 degrees.
- (B) shows a cat going from standing to lying on its back. This orientation change is indicative of a 180-degree rotation along the horizontal axis, matching the 180-degree rotation seen in the top transformation.
- (C) shows a cat that is upright in both images, with a slight turn of its head. There is no rotation that resembles a 180-degree flip.

The step-by-step reasoning for choosing (B) is as follows:

1. We assess that the top transformation of the rooster is a 180-degree rotation.
2. We look at each bottom transformation and identify that (A) and (C) do not entail a 180-degree rotation.
3. We observe that in (B), the cat rotates from standing on its feet to lying on its back, which represents a flip through the horizontal axis resembling a 180-degree rotation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the top part of the puzzle where the transformation of the rooster is displayed from the picture on the left to the right shows that there is no change in color, size, or number of the object. 
2. The only change that occurs is in the orientation of the rooster. In the first image, the rooster is oriented facing towards the right, while in the second image, it is flipped horizontally and is facing towards the left. 
3. The bottom transformations depict various changes in the orientation of the cat figures.
4. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top is the change in orientation of the object.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation at the top of the puzzle, the rooster from the first image to the second image is flipped upside down.
2. This flipping results in the rooster being rotated by 180 degrees. It is not a 90-degree rotation, nor is there no change between pictures. 
3. The rooster was initially facing right-side up, and after the transformation, it is upside down, which is indicative of a 180-degree rotation.
4. None of the other provided rules: 90-degree rotation, no change, or non-applicability, describe this transformation accurately.
5. Accordingly, the correct rule that applies to this transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top transformation shows the rooster being rotated by 180 degrees from the first image to the second.
2. Looking at the options on the bottom, we need to find the transformation that matches the 180-degree rotation seen at the top.

   a. In option (A), the cat is rotated, but it's more of a lateral flip than a 180-degree rotation.
   b. In option (B), the cat is also flipped laterally, not rotated completely upside down.
   c. In option (C), the cat experiences a 180-degree rotation from the first to the second image, much like the rooster on top; it is initially upright and ends upside down.

3. Because options (A) and (B) show lateral flips rather than a full 180-degree rotation, they do not match the transformation of the rooster at the top.
4. Option (C) shows the exact type of transformation – a 180-degree rotation – making it the correct answer that corresponds to the top transformation.",1,0,1

To solve the visual puzzle, we need to examine the transformation between the two objects on top and see which of the given rules best applies.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the objects on the top, it is clear that the number of objects remains the same (one wooden toy with rings).
- The size of the object also remains the same; there is no noticeable increase or decrease in the dimensions of the object.
- The color of the object does not change; it retains its colors in both pictures.
- What changes is the orientation: the object on the left is positioned vertically, and the object on the right is flipped to a horizontal position.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation on the top is the orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle:

Step 1: Observe the orientation of the object in the left image. The object, which appears to be a wooden toy with rings, stands vertically.

Step 2: Compare the left image to the orientation of the object in the right image. The object has been rotated, but it is not upside down or in its original position, which rules out a 180-degree rotation.

Step 3: Determine the degree of rotation. The wooden toy with rings has been rotated in such a way that it lies horizontally in the right image. This indicates that the object has been rotated by 90 degrees from its original position.

Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation on the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(C)

To find which of the three transformations on the bottom is the same as the transformation on the top, we need to identify the rule in the top transformation and then apply it to the transformations at the bottom.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. As previously established, the rule for the top transformation is a 90-degree rotation of the object (from vertical to horizontal orientation).

2. Now let's analyze the bottom transformations:

- Transformation (A) shows an office chair that has been flipped upside down, which is more than a 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (B) also shows the office chair being flipped upside down, like in (A), once again more than a 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (C) shows the chair having turned from being upright to lying on its side, indicating a rotation of approximately 90 degrees.

3. Since transformation (C) shows a 90-degree rotation, much like the top transformation, it is the one that follows the same rule.

Therefore, the transformation at the bottom of the puzzle that is the same as the transformation on the top of the puzzle is (C).",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows an object (looks like a dumbbell or a weight) that goes from a horizontal position on the left to a vertical position on the right. The size, the number, and the color of the object do not change; only the orientation does.
- Looking at the three sets of transformations on the bottom marked (A), (B), and (C), we can see that they also represent changes in the orientation of the office chairs from one image to the next.
- Rule (1) Number of objects is not applicable because the number of objects (dumbbells/chairs) remains the same in the transformation. 
- Rule (3) Color of objects does not apply, as the colors remain consistent throughout the transformation.
- Rule (4) No change between pictures is not fitting because there is a clear change occurring, which is the reorientation of the objects.
- Rule (5) Doesn't apply is not relevant for the reasoning because one of the rules does indeed apply here, which is the change in orientation.
- The evident matching rule for the transformation on top is the orientation of the objects (Rule 2).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation at the top of the puzzle shows an object that rotates between the left and right images. The left side shows the object with the long axis horizontal. In the next image to the right, the object's long axis is vertical. This rotation corresponds to a quarter turn, which is 90 degrees.
- Rule (1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees does not match the transformation because that would imply the object is flipped upside down or turned around to face the opposite direction, which did not occur here.
- Rule (3) No change between pictures is not fitting because there is a noticeable change in the orientation of the object, which is the rotation.
- Rule (4) Doesn't apply is not relevant as one of the rules does apply, which is the rotation of the object by 90 degrees (Rule 2). Thus, the correct rule describing the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the object rotates by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- As established in the previous answers, the transformation on top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the object from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation.
- Now, we must examine the transformations labeled (A), (B), and (C) to see which one shows a similar 90-degree rotation.

(A) - This transformation shows a rotation; however, the final orientation of the chair is not a 90-degree rotation from the starting orientation. The second and third pictures in sequence (A) seem to depict the chair upside down, indicating rotations beyond 90 degrees.

(B) - This sequence shows a chair that rotates 90 degrees from the first position to the second. The orientation of the chair's seat in the second image is vertical, matching the 90-degree rotation rule observed in the top transformation.

(C) - In this transformation, we also see rotations, but similar to (A), the rotations go beyond 90 degrees, showing chairs in positions that indicate flips or turns closer to 180 degrees or more.

- The correct transformation that matches the top one is (B) because it shows an object (the chair) rotating by 90 degrees from left to right.",1,1,0

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation on the top of the puzzle, let's examine the changes from the left image to the right image:

1. The wooden object on the top left has the horizontal axes of its end caps facing to the left and the right. In the image to its right, the horizontal axes of the end caps are facing up and down. There is a 90-degree rotation around the axis that runs through the center of the end caps, which indicates a change in orientation.

2. The size of the object does not change when comparing the images on the top.

3. The number of objects remains consistent—there is one wooden object in both the left and the right images.

4. The color of the object also does not change; it remains consistent between the two images.

Based on these observations, the rule that applies to the transformation at the top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects, as this is the only attribute that has changed.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle, let's go through the transformation step by step:

1. The left-most image depicts the wooden object with its side arms pointing to the left and right.

2. In the right-most image, the same object has its side arms pointing up and down.

This change indicates that the object has undergone a rotation.

3. Since the direction of the side arms has changed from left-right to up-down, we can deduce that the object has been rotated by 90 degrees around the axis that runs through the center of its end caps.

There is no indication of a 180-degree rotation, as that would result in the side arms still pointing left-right, but the object would appear flipped. In this case, the orientation of the arms has shifted by a quarter turn, which is consistent with a 90-degree rotation.

Therefore, rule (2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees is the correct description for the transformation occurring at the top of the puzzle.","(B)

To identify which of the three transformations (A, B, or C) at the bottom of the puzzle corresponds to the transformation at the top of the puzzle, which we have determined to be a 90-degree rotation, we should evaluate each option step-by-step:

(A) The first image shows an office chair upright; the second image shows the chair fallen on its back. This is not simply a rotation but a change in position from standing to fallen, indicating that it is not the same transformation as on the top.

(B) The first image shows the office chair facing the viewer with the backrest upwards; in the second image, the chair is rotated so that the backrest is now facing downwards, which corresponds to a 90-degree rotation around the axis through the center of the seat. This matches the 90-degree rotation we observe at the top of the puzzle.

(C) The first and second images show the chair upright, with no apparent rotation or positional change besides a slight apparent movement. There's no rotation that matches the top transformation.

Given these evaluations, (B) is the transformation that matches the 90-degree rotation seen at the top of the puzzle.",1,1,0

To solve this puzzle, let us compare the transformation taking place in the top row with the transformations in the three boxes below it.

Top Transformation Analysis:
- We see a cactus that is upright in the first image.
- In the second image, the cactus has been rotated clockwise, laying flat on an implied horizontal plane.

Bottom Transformation Analysis:
(A) In this transformation, there is no change in orientation, only a translation (shift in position), which does not match the top transformation.
(B) This transformation shows a rotation; the compass has been turned so that its orientation has changed. This is a match in terms of the rules governing the changes taking place in the top transformation.
(C) Here we observe an addition of an element—the loop for hanging the compass—so this does not match the top transformation, which involves solely an orientation change and no addition of elements.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the top transformation is the orientation of objects, which is represented by sequence (B) at the bottom.","(1)

Let's analyze the visual transformation based on the provided rules:

- In the top transformation, the cactus begins in an upright position.
- In the next frame, the cactus has been rotated onto its side.

To determine by how much the cactus has been rotated, we can consider the orientation of the cactus arms. We'll use the analogy of hands on a clock: if the cactus upright position is 12 o'clock, then the flat position can be likened to 3 o'clock. This indicates a 90-degree rotation.

- Rule (1) states that objects rotate by 90 degrees.
- Rule (2) specifies a 180-degree rotation, which would have resulted in the cactus being upside down; this is not the case here.
- Rule (3) suggests no change between pictures, which clearly does not apply, as there has been a change.
- Rule (4) states that none of the provided rules apply, which is not true in this case since Rule (1) does apply.

Given that the cactus rotates clockwise from a vertical to a horizontal position, this corresponds to a quarter turn, or 90 degrees. Thus, the correct rule for the transformation on top is (1), as the cactus rotates by 90 degrees from its original position.","(A)

To determine which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation on the top, we need to look for a 90-degree rotation, as established earlier. 

Let's analyze them:

- (A) shows a compass being shifted to the right, but the orientation remains the same; there is no rotation involved.
- (B) shows the compass being rotated; however, the compass appears to be rotated by 180 degrees, as we can infer from the flip in the numbers' orientation displaying a upside-down view.
- (C) displays the compass with an added loop element but no rotation.

None of these options show a 90-degree rotation which is observed in the top transformation.

However, upon closer examination, it appears there might have been an oversight regarding (B). Although at first glance it might seem like the compass is turned upside down, looking more closely at the numbers and the positioning of the knob and ring, we see that it has indeed been rotated by 90 degrees, not 180 degrees. The numbers are not upside down; they are rotated, just like in the top transformation. When the compass is rotated, the 6 should be where the 9 originally was. This indicates a 90-degree rotation to the right.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A), because the compass in (A) is rotated by 90 degrees to the right, matching the top transformation of the cactus",1,1,0

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top of the puzzle, the cactus on the left is shown in an upright orientation.
- In the right image, the cactus is shown lying horizontally. This indicates that the cactus has been rotated.
- The change from an upright position to a horizontal position suggests that the cactus has been rotated by 90 degrees.
- There's no indication of a 180-degree rotation as that would require the cactus to be upside down or reversed, which is not the case here.
- Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation at the top is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

- The left-to-right transformation at the top of the puzzle is a 90-degree rotation of the cactus from an upright position to a horizontal one.
- Looking at the transformations of the pocket watches at the bottom (marked by (A), (B), and (C)), we need to identify a similar 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (A) shows a watch that has been flipped open but hasn't rotated with respect to its initial orientation, so this is not a 90-degree rotation.
- Transformation (B) shows a watch that remains upright, with no change in orientation, so there is no rotation here either.
- Transformation (C) shows a pocket watch that has rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from its initial position, similarly to the cactus's rotation.

3. In the transformed image, the cactus is horizontal, which is indicative of a 90-degree rotation from its original upright position.
4. There is no indication of a 180-degree rotation, as that would result in the cactus still being in a vertical position but upside down.
5. The image does not remain the same between the two pictures, so there is a change—hence, option (3) is incorrect.

The changes that occur between these two images do not pertain to size, as the shark remains relatively the same size; nor do they pertain to color, as the coloration of the shark remains consistent. There is also an evident change between pictures, ruling out option (4). Lastly, the rule does apply, eliminating option (5).

The transformation at the top of the puzzle involves the shark toy. In the left image, the shark is oriented with its belly down, and in the right image, the shark has been rotated such that its belly is now facing upward. This indicates that the shark has undergone a half-turn or a 180-degree rotation.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Look at the orientation of the shark in the first (left) image. Note the position of its belly, dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and the direction it faces.
2. Compare the orientation to that of the shark in the second (right) image.
3. Observe that the shark has been flipped upside down, not just turned to the side, which would imply a 90-degree rotation.
4. A 180-degree rotation is the only transformation that results in the shark being positioned belly up while still facing the same direction horizontally.

Since the shark is not in the same orientation in the two pictures, rule (3) does not apply. We also cannot use rule (4) since this transformation clearly applies to the image. Rule (1) would mean the shark was turned to its side, which is not the case, leaving us with rule (2) as the accurate description of the transformation.","(C)

1. We've established that the top transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the shark.
2. In option (A), the lunch bag is rotated, but it's not clear if it's by 180 degrees. It remains upright, and while the front view changes to a side view, this doesn't match a full upside-down rotation.
3. In option (B), the lunch bag is depicted from a different view in each frame, but there is no clear indication of a full 180-degree rotation. We see a rotation or perspective change, but not a definitive flip.
4. In option (C), the lunch bag starts upright and then is depicted upside down in the third frame, indicating it's been rotated 180 degrees. The opening flap of the lunch bag is down in the first image, while it is up in the last image, demonstrating that the bag has flipped over completely, akin to the shark rotation at the top of the puzzle.

- In the second image, the shark is oriented vertically, with the head pointing upwards.

- Option (C) shows a lunch bag rotating by 90 degrees clockwise from one image to the next, matching the type of transformation seen with the shark.

- In the right image, the shark's belly is now facing downwards, and its dorsal side is facing upwards.

This indicates that the shark has been flipped over to show the opposite side, which corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees.

For the top transformation:
- The left image shows the toy with its blue wheels on the sides, and the number ""2"" visible on the red midsection.
- The right image shows the toy rotated 90 degrees clockwise, so the blue wheels are now at the top and bottom, and the ""N"" is visible on the midsection which is facing the viewer, suggesting that the orientation has changed from an upright ""2"" to a sideways ""N.""

The visual puzzle on the top shows that the toy undergoes a rotation from the left image to the right image. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- In the left image, the toy is oriented upright with the blue wheels on the sides.
- The right image shows the toy has been rotated since the blue wheels are now positioned at the top and the bottom.
- Additionally, the midsection which originally showed the number ""2"" is now rotated such that an ""N"" is visible, indicating a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The ""N"" suggests that it is the reverse side of the ""2"", completing a half rotation.

Therefore, given the nature of the transformation and considering the positions of the wheels and the visible part of the midsection, it is clear that the toy has been rotated by 90 degrees. Rule (1) best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle.","(C)

The transformation on the top of the puzzle features an object rotating by 90 degrees. Now, examining the bottom three transformations:

- For option (B), the pizza changes its orientation, but it rotates more than 90 degrees, approximately 180 degrees, from the left to the right image.
- For option (C), the pizza slice rotates by 90 degrees clockwise from the left to the right image, which matches the type of transformation that occurs in the example at the top with the toy.

(2) Orientation of objects

To explain this step-by-step:

1. We observe the object at the top left, which appears to be a figure with wheels arranged in a manner that resembles a race car or a cartoon-like character. The figure has a '2' on its front, presumably representing the number '2'.

2. We then look at the object at the top right, and we see the same figure, but now it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Additionally, the '2' on the previous front of the character is now on its side, and we see an 'N' where the '2' used to be. This indicates that the figure has turned, but the colors and number of elements remain unchanged.

3. The color of the figure has not changed, so rule (1) does not apply.

4. The number of elements of the figure has not changed, so rule (3) does not apply.

5. There has been a change between the pictures, specifically in orientation, so rule (4) does not apply.

6. There is clearly a transformation happening, so rule (5) doesn’t apply either.

To explain this step-by-step:

1. Observe the object on the left at the top. This object appears to be in an upright position with the orientation suggesting the 'front' of the object is facing the viewer.

2. Now look at the object on the right at the top. This object is the same as the one on the left but it has been rotated. The 'front' of the object, which previously faced the viewer, has been rotated to the right, implying a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

3. This rotation is not 180 degrees because the object has not been turned upside down or to face the opposite direction.

4. There is a change between the pictures, so rule (3) does not apply.

5. There is clearly a transformation happening, which means rule (4) doesn't apply.

Thus, the correct answer is (2), indicating that the object has been rotated by 90 degrees from the picture on the left to the picture on the right at the top of the puzzle.","The correct answer is (B).

To explain this step-by-step:

1. We have already established that the rule for the top transformation is a 90-degree rotation of the object.

2. Next, we need to look at the three transformations at the bottom, marked (A), (B), and (C), to determine which one corresponds to a 90-degree rotation.

3. Transformation (A) does not match because the pizza slices are flipped vertically, which resembles a 180-degree rotation in the plane of the pizza, not a 90-degree rotation.

4. Transformation (B) matches the rule because each slice of the pizza is rotated 90 degrees to the right, which is the same transformation applied to the object at the top.

5. Transformation (C) shows the pizza with a piece being removed or eaten, which is not a rotation, so it does not match the rule.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the transformation of the object at the top from the left picture to the right picture, we can observe that there is a change in the orientation of the object. Specifically, the object (which appears to be a toy with wheels and a number on it) rotates from facing the viewer to a side view, showing its profile.
- There is no change in the number of objects, as only one object is present in both images.
- There is no change in the size of the object, as it appears to maintain a consistent scale between the left and right images.
- There is no addition or subtraction of objects, hence rule (4) No change between pictures does not apply.
- By examining these attributes, we can conclude that the transformation is exclusively related to the orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule (1).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top of the puzzle, we see a toy with wheels and a number on the left picture.
- In the right picture, the same toy is shown from a side profile.
- By observing the relative position of the wheels in both pictures and the orientation of the number, it's clear that the toy has been rotated around its central axis.
- This rotation aligns with a 90-degree turn, as it changes from facing the viewer to showing a side profile, which is a quarter turn.
- There is no rotation that would correspond to a 180-degree turn since that would have inverted the toy, showing the back side as the front.
- There's obviously a change between the pictures, so rules (3) No change between pictures and (4) Doesn't apply are not relevant.

By examining these details, we can confirm that the change is a 90-degree rotation of the object, which is described by rule (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation on top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the object.
- Now we must compare this transformation to the three sequences marked (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom.

Looking at the options:
- Sequence (A) shows a giraffe that flips from standing to lying on its back between the first and second frames. This is a rotation, but it is a flip around the horizontal axis, not a 90-degree rotation.
- Sequence (B) shows a giraffe that remains upright but facing in a different direction from the first to the second frame. This is not a 90-degree rotation; it might be closer to a 180-degree turn as it appears to represent the front and back view of the giraffe.
- Sequence (C) shows a giraffe that initially stands upright and then lies on its side in the second frame. This transformation resembles a 90-degree rotation similar to the top puzzle where the object transitions from front-facing to a side profile.

Therefore, the sequence that matches the same transformation (a 90-degree rotation) as seen on the top of the puzzle is sequence (C).",1,1,1

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation seen in the top part of the puzzle, let's compare the left and right images:

1. The size of the object (snowman-like toy) remains consistent between the two images. Therefore, rule (1) can be ruled out.
2. The color of the object remains consistent between the two images. Hence, rule (3) is also not applicable.
3. There is a change in the object between the pictures, so rule (4) does not apply.
4. The number of objects shown in the two images is the same – there is one object in each image. This means rule (5) doesn't apply either.
5. The most noticeable change is in the orientation of the object. In the left image, the object is upright, with the number ""2"" visible. In the right image, the object is on its side, with the number ""2"" flipped, and one of the wheels has also become a prominent feature at the top.

This means that the transformation occurring here involves a change in the orientation of the object, which corresponds to rule (2).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's analyze the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle again:

1. Between the two pictures of the snowman-like toy, there is not a rotation of 180 degrees because that would put the toy upside down, which is not shown in the images.
2. There is a change between the pictures, so rule (3) does not apply.
3. Since we can see a change in orientation, rule (4) doesn't apply either, as this indicates some sort of transformation does occur.
4. The toy rotates in such a way that its faces (front becoming the top, and top becoming the rear) have shifted by a quarter turn. Given the orientation of the number ""2"" on the toy, and considering how we would need to turn the toy for the ""2"" to appear sideways as in the second image, a rotation by 90 degrees is the most fitting description.

The position of the object indicates it has been rotated around a horizontal axis that goes from front to back through the object. The number ""2"" transitions from a front-facing position to a top-facing position, indicating a quarter turn (a 90-degree rotation) along this axis. Therefore, the correct rule describing the transformation is (2).","(C)

To find which of the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation at the top, let's analyze each option (A), (B), and (C):

- In option (A), the object (a giraffe) rotates, but it's a flip rather than a rotation along a horizontal axis. After the transformation, the giraffe is upside down.
- In option (B), the giraffe tilts backward but remains upright, which does not match a 90-degree rotation around the horizontal axis.
- In option (C), the giraffe undergoes a 90-degree rotation, moving from an upright position in the first image to a sideways facing position in the second image, which matches the same kind of 90-degree rotation observed in the transformation of the object on top of the puzzle.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C), as it is the only transformation that involves a similar 90-degree rotation along a horizontal axis.",1,1,0

- In the left image, there is a toy with a clear front and back orientation, upright on its wheels.
- In the right image, the toy has been flipped around a horizontal axis so that it's now upside down while still maintaining the front-facing direction.

This change demonstrates a clear modification in the orientation of the object.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- There is no change in the number of objects; there is still just one toy in each image.
- There is no change in the size; the toy remains the same size.
- There is no change in color; the colors remain consistent between the two images.
- The change observed is exclusively in the orientation of the toy from an upright to an upside-down position.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

For the top transformation:
- In the left image, we see the toy oriented with its wheels on the ground and the number ""2"" visible in its correct orientation.
- In the right image, the toy is upside-down, with the wheels in the air and the number ""2"" also appearing upside-down.

This indicates the toy has been rotated around an axis (say, left-to-right) by 180 degrees.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation is not a rotation of 90 degrees because that would place the toy on its side instead of it being upside-down.
- There is clearly a change between the pictures, so we can rule out the option that there is no change.
- The rule that doesn't apply (4) is not an option here because a definite change has occurred.

Comparing the left-to-right object transformations on the bottom of the puzzle with the transformation on the top:

- (B) displays a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the giraffe around a vertical axis between the two frames.
- (C) presents a giraffe that has been rotated 180 degrees around a horizontal axis, similar to the toy on the top, as evidenced by the second giraffe being upside-down relative to the first one.

- Option (A) maintains the orientation of the giraffe and doesn't show any rotation or flipping.
- Option (B) has a rotation but only 90 degrees, not the 180 degrees shown on the top.
- Option (C) demonstrates the same type of transformation as the object on the top: a 180-degree rotation around a horizontal axis. The result is the giraffe being upside-down in the second frame, which corresponds to the upside-down toy in the top right image.

2. Confirm the change: No other aspects (size, number, or color) of the kayak have changed. The only change from left to right that can be observed is in orientation.

4. Conclusion: The left-to-right transformation on top involves a change in the orientation of the kayak, fitting rule (1) Orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Let's analyze the top transformation with the kayak:

1. Observe the kayak's initial and final position: The kayak in the left picture is oriented with the front facing towards the upper right corner. In the right picture, the front of the kayak is facing the lower right corner.

2. Determine the degree of rotation: A 180-degree rotation would invert the position of the kayak, making the front face the opposite direction, which is exactly what we observe in the transformation from the left picture to the right picture.

3. Verify the rotation: The double-bladed paddle's positions relative to the kayak also support a 180-degree rotation, as the orientation of the paddle has flipped from one side to the other, along with the kayak's orientation change.

4. Rule out other rules: A 90-degree rotation would not result in the positions observed, because the front of the kayak would merely switch from facing the upper right corner to the upper left corner, or to the lower right corner, depending on the direction of rotation. Therefore, Rule (1) does not apply. Rule (3) is not applicable as a change does occur between the pictures.

2. Examine (A): Transformation (A) shows guitars that have not changed in orientation; they remain in the same position relative to each other. Therefore, this does not match the 180-degree rotation seen in the kayak's transformation.

3. Examine (B): Transformation (B) shows guitars where one guitar has changed position and is facing the opposite direction, indicative of a 180-degree rotation. However, in addition to this change in orientation, there is also a change in the number of guitars — we now have three instead of two. This transformation includes an extra change that does not match the kayak's singular change in orientation.

4. Examine (C): Transformation (C) depicts guitars that went from a vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation, similar to the kayak's transformation. The orientation of the guitar is flipped 180 degrees with no added changes, which matches the kayak's transformation at the top.

5. Conclusion: The guitar in (C) is rotated by 180 degrees without any other changes, which is the same transformation that was applied to the kayak at the top.",1,0,1

4. There is only one kayak in each image, so the number of objects does not change.
5. The color of the kayaks is consistent across both images, indicating no change in color.
6. Based on this information, the change observed in the top transformation of the puzzle is the orientation of the kayak from one diagonal direction to the opposite diagonal direction.

3. The kayak on the right is positioned with its front pointing down and to the left.
4. This change in position from the left image to the right image shows that the kayak has been rotated.

  - (C) shows two foxes in the same pose in both images, with one standing on hind legs in the second image. This is not solely a rotation but includes a pose change for one fox and no movement for the other.
- Transformation (A) is the one that matches the top transformation because it shows an object (the fox) which has undergone a rotation similar to what we have observed with the butterfly on top. The exact angle of rotation for the fox may not be exactly 90 degrees as it was with the butterfly, but the essence of the transformation, which is a rotation where the object goes from an upright position to a horizontal one (lying down), is the same.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The transformation occurring on the top part of the puzzle features a butterfly. The left image shows the butterfly with its wings spread vertically, and the right image shows the butterfly with its wings spread horizontally.
2. During this transformation, the size and color remain constant, and the number of butterflies does not change.
3. The only change taking place is in the orientation of the butterfly's wings – from a vertical to a horizontal position.
4. Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation seen in the butterfly images is the change in orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Examining the transformation at the top of the puzzle, we see that the butterfly on the left is oriented with its wings pointing upward.
2. In the image on the right, the butterfly's wings are pointing to the side.
3. This change in orientation can be described as a rotation, and since the wings have moved from an up-down orientation to a left-right orientation, this is a quarter turn or a 90-degree rotation.
4. Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation seen in the top images of the puzzle is that the object rotates by 90 degrees.","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We have already established that the transformation on the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation of the butterfly from a vertical to a horizontal orientation.
2. We will now examine the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to see which one matches this rule:

   - Option (A) shows a fox, first with its body oriented upwards and then oriented rightwards in the second image. This reflects a 90-degree clockwise rotation, mirroring the top transformation.
   - Option (B) shows a fox that appears to be disassembled or broken apart in the second image. There is no rotation; the image has been changed in a different way.
   - Option (C) shows a fox that has been split into two separate parts in the second image, also showing a different type of change than rotation.

3. Given this analysis, only option (A) demonstrates the same type of transformation as seen at the top of the puzzle - a 90-degree rotation. Therefore, the answer is (A).",1,1,0

In the top part of the puzzle, the left-to-right transformation involves the rotation of an object. The object on the left is oriented with the pointy end towards the top right and in the right image, the object is rotated with the pointy end now pointing straight to the right. This change represents a transformation in orientation.

Now, let's examine the transformations in each of the labeled transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to confirm our rule:

- (A) shows no change in orientation between the two sandwiches.
- (B) shows a rotation where the left sandwich is upright and the right one is lying on its side, representing a change in orientation.
- (C) again shows no change in orientation between the two sandwiches.

Given that, we can confirm that the top transformation demonstrates rule (3) Orientation of objects, as it is the only change taking place in the sequence.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a rotation. In the first image, the object is oriented diagonally with the pointy end toward the upper right. In the second image, the object has been rotated so that the pointy end is now facing directly to the right. This is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the initial orientation of the object in the first image on the left.
2. Compare with the orientation of the object in the second image on the right.
3. Determine the degree of rotation necessary to achieve the change in orientation from the first image to the second.
4. Confirm that the rotation is indeed 90 degrees and in a clockwise direction, fitting the description for rule (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

To determine which transformation on the bottom of the puzzle corresponds to the transformation on the top, we need to compare the orientations of the objects in each pair:

- (A) shows two sandwiches with the same orientation, so there is no rotation between them, and thus it does not match the top transformation.
- (B) shows the left sandwich in an upright position and the right sandwich rotated 90 degrees onto its side. This rotation is the same kind of 90-degree change seen in the top transformation.
- (C) shows two sandwiches with the same orientation, similar to (A), which means there is no rotation between them, excluding this option as well.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify that the transformation on the top involves a 90-degree rotation.
2. Look at each pair of objects at the bottom to see if they involve a rotation:
   - Pair (A) does not rotate; it remains the same.
   - Pair (B) rotates by 90 degrees.
   - Pair (C) does not rotate; it remains the same.

- When comparing the left and right images, the only change we observe is a change in the orientation.
- The clownfish in the left image is oriented with its head pointing to the upper left, while in the right image, the fish's head is pointing more towards the upper right.
- There is no change in the number, size, or color of the object; only its orientation has changed from the left image to the right image.
- Thus, the rule that best describes the transformation of the object on top is ""orientation of objects.""","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In the top part of the visual puzzle, the clownfish on the left is oriented diagonally, with its head pointing to the upper left and tail to the lower right.
- In the right image, the clownfish is also oriented diagonally, but now its head points to the upper right and tail to the lower left.
- This change in orientation indicates a rotation, and by observing the direction of the head and tail, we can deduce it is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
- The rotation changes the fish's orientation from pointing to the upper left to pointing to the upper right.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation from the left picture to the right picture on top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The transformation on the top of the puzzle involved rotating the object by 90 degrees.
- We must compare the object transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to identify a similar transformation.
- For (A), the sandwich's orientation changes from a diagonal position to a horizontal position, which is not a 90-degree rotation.
- For (B), the sandwich's position changes from horizontal to vertical, which is a 90-degree rotation, but it rotates in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) compared to the top transformation, which was clockwise.
- For (C), the sandwich's position changes from facing down diagonally to facing up diagonally, which is the same direction of 90-degree clockwise rotation as the clownfish on top.
- Therefore, the bottom transformation marked by (C) is the same as the top transformation.",1,1,0

In the top transformation of the puzzle, we see a caterpillar undergoing a left-to-right transformation. On the left, the caterpillar is oriented with its head pointing to the upper left and its tail to the lower right. In the picture on the right, the caterpillar's orientation has changed; its head is now pointing to the upper right, and its tail is pointing to the lower left. This indicates that the transformation rule for the top sequence is the change in the orientation of the object. The size, color, and number of components in the caterpillar remain unchanged, and there is clearly a change between pictures, eliminating rules related to size, color, number, and no change.","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

The top transformation of the puzzle shows a caterpillar that rotates between the left and right images. To go from the orientation of the caterpillar on the left to the orientation on the right, we can infer that a 180-degree rotation has occurred. The head of the caterpillar, which was initially pointing to the upper left, is now pointing to the upper right, and its body has flipped accordingly, which is consistent with a half-turn or 180-degree rotation.

The other rules listed don't apply here:
- A 90-degree rotation (Rule 2) would have placed the caterpillar with its head pointing either straight up or straight down, which is not the case.
- There is an obvious change between the pictures (Rule 3) due to the rotation, so it's not a ""no change"" scenario.
- Since the rotation can be clearly defined, Rule 4 (Doesn't apply) is not relevant here.","(C)

Examining the three sets of transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C) at the bottom of the puzzle, we are looking for one that matches the top transformation, which is a 180-degree rotation.

- In (A), the sub-sandwich remains in the same orientation between the two images, so there is no rotation, and it does not match the top transformation.
- In (B), the sub-sandwich appears to rotate, but it is only a 90-degree rotation since the top of the sandwich is now facing to the right, not a 180-degree rotation as shown in the top transformation.
- In (C), the sub-sandwich has clearly performed a 180-degree rotation. The top of the sandwich, which is initially facing upward in the first image, is now facing downward in the second image, which is the same type of rotation observed in the top transformation with the caterpillar.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the top part of the visual puzzle, we see a single object that appears to be a backpack with facial features. The transformation from the left picture to the right picture shows a change in the orientation of the backpack; it rotates without altering its size, color, or number.

2. No other changes are observed between the two pictures, therefore we can conclude that the transformation rule pertaining to the orientation of objects is the one that best describes the change seen in the top part of the puzzle.

3. The other possible rules such as change in size, number, or color do not apply here because the only change we see is the orientation: the backpack has been flipped over to a different side. There is no size change, number change (it remains one backpack), or color change.

4. Consequently, the rule that fits this transformation is the orientation of objects, hence the answer is (2).","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the top of the visual puzzle, we see the backpack with facial features, which undergoes a transformation from the left picture to the right picture. 

2. By closely examining the initial and final positions of the backpack, we can determine the degree of rotation. In the left picture, the backpack is upright with the facial features visible and in the correct orientation. In the right picture, the backpack is upside down with the facial features also upside down, indicating that it has undergone a half-turn.

3. A rotation where an object turns upside down, meaning the top becomes the bottom, is a 180-degree rotation. 

4. There is no 90-degree rotation, because that would put the backpack on its side, which is not the case here. There is also clearly a change between pictures, so rule (3) is not applicable.

5. Rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is not applicable here as well because a transformation has occurred—specifically, a rotation.

6. Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation of the backpack is a 180-degree rotation, which corresponds to (2).","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The transformation of the top object (backpack) involved a 180-degree rotation.

2. Now let's inspect the transformations in each of the three pairs of images shown at the bottom of the puzzle to find a similar transformation:

   - In transformation (A), the left image shows a bug with its legs outstretched and wings spread, while the right image shows the same bug with its legs and wings contracted. There's no rotation involved here.

   - In transformation (B), the left image shows the bug oriented with its legs and wings outstretched towards the upper right, and the right image shows the bug facing downwards with legs and wings directed to the lower right. This change in orientation involves a rotation, but it doesn't appear to be close to 180 degrees; it's more like a 90-degree rotation.

   - In transformation (C), the left image shows the bug with legs and wings spread out, facing the left side, and the right image shows the bug in the same position but upside down, facing the right side, signifying a 180-degree rotation.

3. Transformation (C) matches the 180-degree rotation observed in the transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle, so this is the correct answer. 

The transformations in (A) and (B) do not match the 180-degree rotation seen at the top of the puzzle. Therefore, based on step-by-step analysis, the",1,0,0

1. Looking at the top transformation, we can see that the object (which appears to be a whimsically designed container resembling a face) is being rotated from the left position to the right position.

2. The size of the object does not change, ruling out rule number (1).

3. The number of objects remains the same; there is only one in both the left and right pictures, so rule number (2) does not apply.

4. There is a clear change between the two pictures; therefore, rule number (4) cannot be correct.

5. Given that there is a change and it is specific to the orientation, rule number (5) (Doesn't apply) is not suitable for this transformation.

6. The only change we observe is that the object on the left is upright, and in the transition to the right image, it is rotated (sideways), indicating the transformation relates to the orientation of the object.

The conclusion is that the rule best describing the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is the orientation of the objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the images at the top, we notice that the whimsical container with a face has been rotated between the left and the right images.

2. The container on the left is upright (the opening at the top), and in the right image, it has been rotated to the side. The position of the handles and the facial features (like the eyes) indicate a quarter turn, which is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation.

3. This rotation is not 180 degrees, as that would mean the container would be upside-down in the right image, which it is not. Therefore, rule number (2) is ruled out.

4. There is a change between the pictures; the orientation of the object has changed, so it cannot be rule number (3).

5. Since we can determine the specific change, rule number (4) (Doesn't apply) does not fit this scenario.

Consequently, the most accurate rule that describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We've already identified that the transformation on the top of the puzzle is a 90-degree rotation of the object.

2. Now we need to evaluate the transformations at the bottom of the puzzle marked (A), (B), and (C) to find a match.

3. Looking at option (A), the object (which is a bug) does not rotate between the images; it simply moves position from left to right within the frame. Therefore, (A) is not the correct answer.

4. Examining option (B), the bug is initially upright in the first image and in the second image, it is rotated 90 degrees to the right (the bug's back is now closest to the viewer). This matches the 90-degree rotation observed in the top transformation. Therefore, (B) is a likely match.

5. Finally, inspecting option (C), the bug is initially upright in the first image and in the second image, it is rotated but in a way that it faces away from the viewer, which would be a 180-degree turn, not a 90-degree turn like the one in the top transformation. Thus, (C) is not the correct answer.

To arrive at this conclusion, we can observe that the object on top, which seems to be a box with accessories attached to it, is rotating from left to right. In the left image, the front of the object is facing towards us, while in the right image, it is rotated to show the side of the object. There is no change in size, color, or number of objects, so the transformation rule that best describes this change is the orientation of the objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To arrive at this conclusion, let's analyze the top part of the puzzle step by step:

2. Examine the orientation of the box itself: In the left image, the front of the box is facing us, showing the face with the eyes and mouth. In the right image, the box has been rotated so that the side with the eyes and mouth is now on the side, and the top of the box is what is facing the viewer.

3. Consider the nature of the rotation: The movement from the first position where the handles are pointing upwards to the second position where they point to the right is a quarter turn, equating to a 90-degree rotation.

Hence, the rule that best describes the transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

To determine which of the transformations (A), (B), or (C) on the bottom of the puzzle matches the transformation on the top, we need to observe and compare the changes from left to right in each option:

1. In transformation (A), the object (a stylized insect) is not rotating but is instead experiencing a change in the orientation of its appendages (legs and claws) from a more extended to a more contracted position. This does not match the 90-degree rotational change seen in the top transformation.

2. In transformation (B), the object (the same stylized insect) rotates in such a way that its orientation changes by 90 degrees from left to right, similar to the box on top. It rotates clockwise if we assume that we are looking at the objects from above.

3. In transformation (C), there is no rotation between the objects; instead, we see a change in the orientation of the appendages, similar to transformation (A).

To solve this visual puzzle, let's analyze the transformation of the object in the top portion of the image from left to right and apply that insight to the bottom portion of the image.

Step 1: Identify the transformation of the top object.
- The croissant on the left is positioned with its ends pointing roughly to the top left and bottom right corners of the image.
- The croissant on the right is rotated so that its ends now point roughly to the top right and bottom left corners of the image.

Step 2: Confirm the rule.
- The size of the croissant does not change between the images.
- The number of croissants remains the same (there is one croissant in each image).
- The color of the croissant remains the same in both images.
- There is a change between the pictures, so option (4) No change between pictures is not applicable.

The transformation that best describes the change from the left picture to the right is a change in the orientation of the object (the croissant). Thus, the rule that applies is (3) Orientation of objects.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Let's examine the transformation:

Step 1: Observe the initial orientation of the croissant on the left.
- It is positioned with the ends pointing diagonally, roughly to the top left and bottom right.

Step 2: Observe the orientation of the croissant on the right after transformation.
- The croissant has been rotated so that the ends now point to the top right and bottom left.

Step 3: Determine the degree of rotation needed for this change in orientation.
- To go from the initial to the final position, the croissant has to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.

There is a change between the pictures, so option (3) No change between pictures is not applicable. Since the croissant is rotated and it does not match any context where rule (4) Doesn't apply, and it is not a rotation by 180 degrees, we can confirm that the correct answer is:

To find which of the three transformations on the bottom matches the transformation on the top, we must apply the same rule determined earlier:

Step 1: Recall that the croissant on top has been rotated by 90 degrees.

Step 2: Apply the 90-degree rotation rule to each of the three options (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom.
- For option (A), the flowers in the first frame are pointing up, and in the second frame, they have been rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- For option (B), the flowers and leaves in the first frame are pointing up, while in the second frame, they have been rearranged and changed to a different configuration, not merely rotated.
- For option (C), the flowers in the first frame are pointing up, and in the second frame, they have been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which matches the transformation observed in the top row.

Step 3: Identify the matching transformation.
- Option (C) is the only one that shows the same 90-degree clockwise rotation as the croissant on the top.

2. In the left image, the croissant's points are oriented upwards and to the left.
3. In the right image, the croissant is rotated so that the points are now oriented downwards and to the right.
4. The change from the left to the right image involves the croissant being flipped over its horizontal axis.
5. The size, number, and color of the croissant remain constant; only the orientation has changed.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

1. Look at the top part of the puzzle with two images of a croissant.
2. Observe the orientation of the croissant in the left image; it has a particular curve orientation.
3. Now observe the orientation of the croissant in the right image; it appears to have been flipped completely upside down compared to the left image.
4. This change suggests a half-turn or a 180-degree rotation around an axis perpendicular to the image plane, which results in the inverted position of the croissant.
5. There is no indication that the croissant was rotated by any other degree, nor is it the same in both images, which eliminates rules 2 and 3.

The transformation depicted at the top of the puzzle shows a single croissant that is changing orientation from the left image to the right image. Specifically, the left part of the croissant has been rotated upward, resulting in a different angle of the same object, with no changes in size, number, or color. Analyzing the bottom transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C), we can see that none of them involves a change of orientation; they all depict changes in the number of objects. The top transformation does not match any of the transformations at the bottom, indicating that the rule demonstrated at the top is the orientation of objects.","(4) Doesn't apply

The transformation depicted at the top of the puzzle shows a single croissant that is changing orientation, as previously noted. However, the orientation change is not a perfect 90-degree or 180-degree rotation. Instead, it is a more subtle rotation or bending, changing the overall shape from a more open crescent to a tighter crescent shape.

1. If we analyze the left to the right transformation of the croissant, there isn't a clear 90-degree or 180-degree rotation, but rather a continuous deformation.
2. A 90-degree rotation would position the croissant such that what was initially either the top or bottom becomes the new left or right side, which is not the case here.
3. A 180-degree rotation would invert the croissant, making the left part appear on the right and vice versa, which is also not observed here.
4. Thus, the transformations involving 90-degree or 180-degree rotations do not accurately describe the change seen in the top images.

Given this information, the rule describing the transformation at the top cannot be (1) or (2), and since there is an obvious change, it cannot be (3) either. Thus, only (4) Doesn't apply remains as the appropriate rule to describe the transformation of the croissant.","(D)

Upon close examination of the transformations on the bottom of the puzzle, labeled as (A), (B), and (C), we can determine that none of these match the transformation seen on the top with the croissant. The transformation at the top involves a change in the object's orientation. Here's the reasoning:

1. Transformation (A) shows an increase in the number of flowers from one image to the next.
2. Transformation (B) also shows an increase in the number of flowers but in a different manner than (A).
3. Transformation (C) shows a constant number of flowers but in two separate clusters in the first image and merged into one cluster in the second image.

None of these bottom transformations involve a change in the orientation of the objects as seen in the top transformation with the croissant. In each case at the bottom (A, B, and C), there is a change in the number of flowers, while the top transformation only involves a change in the croissant's orientation without any change in number, size, or color.

2. The rules are to identify the change in orientation, size, number, or color between two pictures. Rule (3) specifically pertains to the orientation of objects.
3. Since the only change observed is the orientation of the crocodile (it pivots around its center), we conclude that the rule governing the transformation at the top of the puzzle is about the orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the starting and finishing positions of the crocodile in the top pictures. The crocodile starts in an upright position and ends in a horizontal position.

3. Compare this observation with the provided rules to find a match. There is no 180-degree rotation, as that would put the crocodile upside down. There is certainly a change in orientation, so rules (3) and (4) don't apply.

3. Transformation (B) shows the gingerbread man rotating approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, changing from a vertical orientation to a horizontal one, similar to the crocodile's movement.

4. Transformation (C) has another slight rotation of the gingerbread man, but again, it is not a full 90-degree turn and is insufficient to match the crocodile's transformation.

The consistent change we observe here is the rotation or orientation of the dinosaur, while other attributes (such as the color, size, and number of dinosaurs) remain unchanged.

Comparing this to the transformations in series (A), (B), and (C), we can rule out color (2) and size (3), since these attributes don't change in the top series, whereas orientation is the parameter that is being modified consistently.

In each step, the dinosaur rotates 90 degrees to the right. This demonstrates that the rule being applied to the transformation is that objects rotate by 90 degrees with each step.","(C)

Let's analyze each of the three sequences (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom of the puzzle to determine which one corresponds to the transformation sequence at the top of the puzzle where the dinosaur rotates 90 degrees to the right with each step:

1. Sequence (A) shows two images of a gingerbread man. The gingerbread man appears to be in the same orientation in both images, so there is no rotation occurring here.

2. Sequence (B) also shows two images of the gingerbread man. The gingerbread man appears to rotate between the two images, but this rotation is a flip or 180-degree rotation, not a 90-degree rotation.

3. Sequence (C) displays two images of a gingerbread man. In the first image, the gingerbread man is upright. In the second image, it has been rotated 90 degrees to the right so that it is lying on its back, similar to what we observed with the dinosaur's rotation from the first to the third image at the top.

Since the transformation sequence (C) exhibits the same 90-degree rightward rotation as the top sequence, it is the correct answer.",1,1,1
43,2,0,90,0,90,180,0,"Based on the visual puzzle provided, the transformation that best describes the left-to-right change on top of the puzzle is:

(1) Orientation of objects

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- In the top transformation, we see a dinosaur figure that changes its orientation from the first image to the second. In the first image, the dinosaur is depicted standing upright, while in the second image, it is depicted as if it is leaping or diving towards the right.

- The change from standing to leaping involves a rotation or repositioning of the dinosaur's body without any alterations in color, size, or number of dinosaurs. There is only one dinosaur in both images, and it maintains its original colors and relative size.

- None of the other rules apply to the top transformation: the color remains unchanged, the size of the dinosaur is consistent between the two images, and there is definitely a change between the pictures (meaning rule 4 is not applicable). Furthermore, as there's only one rule that applies (orientation), rule 5 (doesn't apply) is not relevant.

- For additional confirmation, we can look at the bottom part of the puzzle, which illustrates changes in gingerbread figure orientation across the groups labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each transformation from left to right shows the gingerbread figure rotating along different axes, which corresponds to the same principle illustrated in the top transformation involving orientation change.","The rule that best describes the transformation in the top of the puzzle is:

(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- Observing the top transformation of the dinosaur figure, we notice that the figure's original upright orientation changes to a position that is upside down relative to its starting position.

- If we imagine the dinosaur as if it is on a clock face, standing at 12 o'clock in the first image, it appears to have rotated to be pointing towards 6 o'clock in the second image. This is a half-circle rotation, which equates to 180 degrees.

- The rotation by 90 degrees (rule 1) does not match the transformation because that would imply the dinosaur is positioned sideways (either at 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock position if using the clock face analogy), which is not the case here.

- There is a change between pictures; therefore, rule 3 (no change between pictures) does not apply.

- Since a specific rule regarding the degree of rotation applies to the transformation, rule 4 (doesn't apply) is not relevant.","The transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that matches the transformation on the top is:

(B)

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for this choice:

- On the top of the puzzle, the dinosaur figure rotates by 180 degrees from left to right.

- Looking at the options at the bottom:
  (A) shows a gingerbread figure rolling over on its side, indicating a 90-degree rotation from left to right.
  (B) depicts a gingerbread figure that flips upside down in a 180-degree rotation from left to right, matching the top transformation of the dinosaur.
  (C) shows a gingerbread figure again rotating, but it continues to face roughly the same direction, indicating a 360-degree rotation or a complete turn.

- The only option where the gingerbread figure exhibits a 180-degree rotation, just as the dinosaur on top, is option (B). The figure starts upright and ends upside down in the same way that the dinosaur does.

Hence, option (B) is the matching transformation.",1,0,0

2. Note that the size, color, and number of mugs remain the same between the two images.
3. Observe that the first mug is upright while the second mug is tipped over.
4. The change from the first image to the second image involves the mug being rotated or tipped, thus altering its orientation.
5. Since the transformation involves a change in orientation without changes to size, color, or number, rule (1) Orientation of objects is the best description of the transformation.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Look at the two images of the mug at the top of the puzzle.
2. Notice that the mug on the left is in an upright position, while the mug on the right is on its side.
3. Assess the degree of rotation by considering the position of the mug's handle; it starts vertically and is horizontal in the second image.
4. Determine that the mug has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees to go from the first to the second position (as indicated by this transition from an upright position to laying on its side with its handle pointing to the right).
5. Rule (1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees accurately describes the transformation of the mug at the top of the puzzle as it involves a rotation of 90 degrees from the initial position to the final position.","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. First, recall that the transformation on top involving the mug was a 90-degree rotation.
2. Next, looking at the options at the bottom:

   - (A) shows a pig that flips upside down from the first to the second image, which is a rotation but by 180 degrees, not 90 degrees.
   
   - (B) shows a pig that remains right-side-up but changes its orientation from facing left to facing right. This is also a rotation but by another 180 degrees since it flips horizontally.
   
   - (C) shows a pig that appears to rotate from standing on all fours to sitting on its hind quarters. This resembles a 90-degree rotation similar to the mug's transformation.

3. Identify that while none of the bottom transformations are identical to the top transformation (since the pigs are animate objects and their position change is qualitatively different from the inanimate mug's clear 90-degree rotation), option (C) most closely approximates a 90-degree rotation, as it goes from a horizontal orientation (on all fours) to a vertical orientation (sitting up).

4. Since (C) involves a change in the pig's orientation that closely resembles a 90-degree rotation, it is the most similar to the mug's transformation at the top of the puzzle.",1,1,1
44,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(2)

The transformation from the left to the right for the top object, which is a mug, seems to indicate a change in the orientation of the mug rather than the number, size, or color. Here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. The color of the mug remains the same from left to right - it does not change color, so it's not related to rule (3).
2. The size of the mug also seems consistent between the two images - it does not change size, so rule (3) does not apply.
3. The number of objects remains the same; there is only one mug in both pictures - therefore, rule (1) is not relevant.
4. The mug does not remain unchanged; there is a clear difference between the two pictures - hence, rule (4) is not applicable.

The noticeable change is the way the mug is rotated from an upright position to a sideways position, demonstrating a change in orientation. There's no other transformation relevant to the mug between the two images, so rule (2) - the orientation of objects - is the best fit to describe the transformation.","(1)

The transformation at the top of the puzzle featuring the mug follows the rule where the object rotates by 90 degrees. Here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observing the orientation of the mug in the left picture, it sits in an upright position, with the handle on the side.
2. In the right picture, the mug has been rotated such that the opening is now facing the viewer and the handle is at the top, which indicates a quarter turn rotation which is a 90-degree rotation from the initial position.

There is no rotation that appears to be 180 degrees or no change in the orientation of the object between the pictures, so rules (2) and (3) can be excluded. Rule (4) does not apply here as there is a clear rule governing the transformation, which is the 90-degree rotation described in rule (1). 

Thus, the transformation of the mug from the left picture to the right picture is best described by the rule of objects rotating by 90 degrees (1).","(C)

To find the transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that matches the top transformation, we need to closely compare the objects' orientation changes in each pair. As established before, the mug on top rotates by 90 degrees. Now we examine each pair on the bottom:

- For option (A), the pig figure rotates so that it's standing up in the second picture. This is a change in orientation, but it is not a 90-degree rotation; rather, it is closer to a rotation from laying down to standing up which is about a 90-degree rotation.
- For option (B), the pig rotates, but again it's a change from standing to laying down on the other side, which is more of a flip than a clear 90-degree rotation.
- For option (C), the pig rotates 90 degrees from standing to lying on its back.

Given that the transformation we are looking for is a 90-degree rotation as demonstrated by the mug on the top, the only set of pig figures that shows a similar 90-degree rotation is (C), where the pig is standing in the first image and then lies on its back in the second, which reflects a quarter-turn or 90-degree rotation.",1,1,0

In the top row of the image, the transformation from the left picture to the right picture shows a red mug that has been rotated. The mug's design and color remain consistent, indicating that there is no change in size, number, or color. The only change that occurs is in the orientation of the mug, which starts from an upright position and then is tilted to its side in the second picture.

To support this, let's look at each individual element:
- Size: The mug stays the same size in both images.
- Orientation: There is an evident change; the mug on the left is upright while the mug on the right has been tipped over.
- Number: There is only one mug in both images.
- Color: The color remains constant, it is still red with the same pattern.
- Therefore, the change is purely in terms of orientation.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the top row of the image, we can observe that the red mug on the left is upright, and in the image on the right, the mug has been tipped such that the opening is facing to the left, indicating a rotation around the mug's axis.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The mug in the left image is upright, with its opening facing up.
- In the right image, the mug has been rotated so the opening faces to the left.
- This rotation represents a quarter turn, or a 90-degree rotation, from the perspective of looking straight on at the mug.

No rotations of 180 degrees or no change are exemplified here, and rule (4) doesn't apply as the specific type of rotation is identified and relevant.","(C)

Analyzing the three options on the bottom of the puzzle:

- (A) shows two pigs facing the same direction with no apparent rotation or other transformation.
- (B) shows a pig that has flipped onto its back, representing a 180-degree rotation along its longitudinal axis.
- (C) shows a pig that has been rotated 90 degrees from a standard standing position to being on its side.

The transformation in (C) matches the transformation of the mug on the top of the puzzle, which also rotates by 90 degrees.

- The mug starts upright and is then rotated so that the opening is to the side.
- The pig starts upright and is then rotated to being on its side.

Thus, the left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that matches the top is (C).",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Observing the transformation of the object at the top of the image from left to right, we see that the object, which appears to be a hand truck or dolly, remains consistent in size, color, and number (there's only one object in both images).
- The only change that occurs from the left picture to the right picture is that the orientation of the hand truck has changed. It starts off upright in the first image, and in the second image, it's laying down with the handle touching the ground.
- Since the transformation only involves a change in the orientation of the object, the rule that best describes this transformation is the orientation of objects, which is rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Upon examining the images of the object at the top, which is a hand truck, we can determine the type of rotation it undergoes.
- The first image on the left shows the hand truck in an upright position, with the handles pointing upwards.
- The second image shows the hand truck rotated such that the handles are now touching the ground. This is a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis of the hand truck because the object has been turned to face the opposite direction.
- This 180-degree rotation is consistent throughout the transition from the first to the second image, and no other transformations, such as a 90-degree rotation or no change, are observed.
- Therefore, the rule describing this transformation is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(A)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- We've already established that the transformation at the top involves a 180-degree rotation of the object.
- Now we need to examine the transformations at the bottom, marked by (A), (B), and (C), to see which one involves the same type of rotation.
- Transformation (A) shows an object (a figure resembling a snowman) first facing upright and then facing downward in the next frame. This indicates a 180-degree rotation around a horizontal axis.
- Transformation (B) shows the snowman-like figure going from facing upright to also facing upright but slightly moved to the right, with no rotation involved.
- Transformation (C) shows the snowman-like figure going from facing upright to facing upside down. While it appears to be a rotation, the figure has also moved position from the center to the upper part of the frame.
- The transformation in (A) matches the top transformation type because it involves a 180-degree rotation without any change in the position within the frame or any additional movement.

- In the second (middle) image, the object is tilted onto its front side.
- In the third (rightmost) image, the object is completely upside down from its original orientation.
- There are no changes in the number of bookshelves, color, or any other elements except for the object's orientation.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation is the orientation of the objects, which is identified as rule number (2).","(1) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Looking at the top of the puzzle, we see three images depicting the transformation of an object, which happens to be a pair of stepped bookshelves or racks.
- In the first image, the object is in an upright position.
- In the second image, the object has been rotated, and we now see it from a perspective where it appears to be lying on its front, but this is actually a 90-degree rotation from the first image.
- In the third image, the object has been further rotated to the point where it is completely upside down compared to its original position in the first image.
- This final transformation from the upright position in the first image to the upside-down position in the third image represents a cumulative rotation of 180 degrees.
- Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 180 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).
","(C)

Step-by-step reasoning:

- We previously deduced that the transformation rule for the object on the top of the puzzle is a 180-degree rotation.
- Let's examine the three options at the bottom of the puzzle to determine which follows the same rule:
  
  (A) The first object starts upright, then flips upside down in the second image, and returns to the initial upright position in the third image. This does not match the 180-degree rotation rule since the object returns to its original position.
  
  (B) The first object starts upright, flips upside down (180-degree rotation) in the second image, and in the third image, it reverts to being upright but has changed its face direction (rotated another 180 degrees). The middle part of this sequence involves a 180-degree rotation, but there's an additional transformation by the third image, which adds complexity beyond a simple 180-degree rotation.
  
  (C) The first object starts upright, rotates 90 degrees onto its front side in the second image, and ends up upside down (another 90 degrees, totaling 180 degrees) in the third image. This three-step sequence matches the top sequence exactly: an upright position, followed by a 90-degree rotation, and finally a 180-degree cumulative rotation resulting in an upside-down position.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the puzzle, we see a hand truck, also known as a dolly, in three different images. The hand truck, from left to right, goes from an upright position to being slightly tilted to being completely flat on the ground.

2. Across the images on top, the size of the object remains constant; there is no change in scale.

3. The color of the object does not change throughout the transformation sequence.

4. The number of objects does not change; there is only one hand truck in all three images.

5. The most significant change that occurs is the orientation of the object. The hand truck rotates in space from an upright position to a flat position.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects (1).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. As established earlier, the transformation of the object involves changing the orientation. 

2. Now, we must determine the degree of rotation. To do this, we can compare the position of the hand truck in the first image, where it is upright, to its position in the last image, where it is lying flat on the ground.

3. From the initial upright position to the final flat position, the hand truck appears to have undergone a rotation of 90 degrees around one of its horizontal axes (a quarter turn). It starts in an orientation where one end is pointing up towards the sky, and in the final image, that same end is pointing horizontally.

4. The rotation is not a full 180 degrees, as that would entail the object turning upside down, which is not the case here.

5. Lastly, it is evident that there is a change between the pictures; hence the rule ""No change between pictures"" does not apply.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that objects rotate by 90 degrees (1).","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. To find the transformation on the bottom that matches the transformation on top, we must look for the sequence that shows a 90-degree rotation, according to the earlier analysis.

2. Examining option (A), we see three snowmen with the middle snowman rotated 90 degrees from the first. However, the third snowman is rotated back, which does not match the progressive rotation seen with the hand truck on top.

3. Looking at option (B), the first snowman is upright, the second snowman is rotated at a 90-degree angle (on his back), and the third snowman is rotated again by 90 degrees (upside down compared to the first snowman). This sequential 90-degree rotation matches the transformation seen with the hand truck on top.

4. Considering option (C), the sequence shows a change in the number of snowmen, which does not correspond to the rotation observed in the sequence on top.

  - (B) shows a change in orientation (the object is ""lying down"" on the second image), which matches the top transformation that also involves a change in orientation.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Looking at the top part of the puzzle again, we see the character facing upright on the left, and in the following image, the character is completely inverted, upside down.

- This degree of rotation flips the character completely, such that if it were a real person, they would be standing on their head in the second image.

- Now we need to identify which of the three transformations at the bottom (A, B, or C) exhibits the same 180-degree rotation.

  - In option (A), the object changes in size and orientation but does not complete a 180-degree rotation—it rather looks ""flattened"" or ""squished.""
  - In option (B), the object appears to have been rotated by 180 degrees because it goes from standing up to lying flat, which means the top part of the object is now facing the opposite direction, similar to the character on the top of the puzzle.
  - In option (C), there is no change in orientation or any other property; the objects remain the same from left to right.

- There is no change in the number, size, or color of the character; only the orientation changes.
- Looking at the bottom transformations marked (A), (B), and (C), we are not concerned with these for this question since we are only focusing on the transformation on top.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The left-to-right transformation on top features a figure that rotates from the first position to the second.
- In the first position, the figure is front-facing, and in the second position, the figure is viewed from the side, indicating a quarter turn, which is a 90-degree rotation.
- This transformation does not show a full 180-degree turn, no repetition of the same position (which would indicate no change), and is indeed applicable, so rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is not relevant here.
- Since the figure clearly rotates, rule (3) ""No change between pictures"" is incorrect.
- The correct description of the transformation is that the object rotates by 90 degrees, which aligns with rule number (1).","(C)

- On the top, the character rotates by 90 degrees from a front-facing position to a side view.
- Now, let's examine the transformations at the bottom:

  - (B) shows a single piece that goes from one whole shape to a segmented or ""cut"" shape, and there is no rotation involved, so it's also not the same transformation.
  - (C) shows two identical pieces and from the left to the right, there's a rotation happening. The right piece appears to be a 90-degree rotation of the left piece, similar to what we see on the top.
- Given that the transformation we are looking for is a 90-degree rotation and (C) demonstrates this change in orientation, it matches the transformation on the top of the puzzle.

- On the top of the puzzle, we have a figure that appears to be a toy or statue that has undergone a transformation from the left image to the right image. The object appears to flip horizontally, changing its orientation from facing forward to facing backward.

- Now, let's examine the changes in the three sets (A), (B), and (C) of images on the bottom of the puzzle. These images depict pawns, which are chess pieces.

  - In set (A), there is no change from the left image to the right image. Both pawns maintain the same size, orientation, number, and color.
  
  - In set (B), the pawn on the right has rotated to face downward, which is a change in orientation compared to the pawn on the left which is upright.
  
  - In set (C), the pawn on the right is laid on its side while the pawn on the left is upright. This depicts another change in the pawns' orientation.

Given the transformations observed in the pawns, the only rule that applies to the transformation of the object at the top of the puzzle is the change in orientation (rule number 1). There is no change in size, number, or color of the objects being transformed at the top of the puzzle.","(2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees

Let's review the transformation at the top of the puzzle step by step:

- Observing the top two images, we see that the object, which seems to be a figure or a model, has undergone a transformation from the left image to the right image. The object's position has changed in such a way that it appears to have been rotated horizontally by 180 degrees. This is evident because the front of the figure is seen in the left image, and in the right image, we see the back of the figure. This indicates a half-turn rotation.

- Since all other rules such as a rotation by 90 degrees, no change between pictures, or an unrelated rule do not match the observation, the only rule that describes the transformation accurately is that the object has been rotated by 180 degrees (rule number 2).

Therefore, the correct rule number is (2).","(B)

Let's analyze each of the three transformations on the bottom of the puzzle to determine the one that matches the transformation on the top:

- For set (A), there is no observable change from the left image to the right image. The orientation and position of the pawn remain the same. This does not match the 180-degree rotation seen at the top.

- For set (B), the pawn in the left image is standing upright, and the pawn in the right image has been rotated to lie flat, with its top facing towards us. Although it is difficult to ascertain the exact degree of rotation due to the 2D representation, it suggests a rotation, possibly close to 90 degrees, which is still not a 180-degree rotation, as seen at the top.

- For set (C), the upright pawn in the left image is rotated to lie flat on its side in the right image. This rotation appears to be a half-turn or 180-degree rotation on a horizontal plane, similar to what we observe in the top transformation.

Considering the above evaluations, set (C) shows a pawn that has been rotated by approximately 180 degrees from its starting position, similar to the transformation seen at the top, where the figure also underwent a 180-degree rotation.

4. Based on this comparison, the rule describing the transformation from the left image to the right on top of the puzzle is the orientation of objects. 

There's no applicable rule for a change in the state of the object (open or closed), so we focus on the change in orientation since that is the visible transformation that matches one of the provided rule options.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

2. Look at the right image on top, which shows the cabinet laid horizontally and open.
3. Determine the degree of rotation required for the transformation: The cabinet has been rotated from a vertical to a horizontal position, which indicates a 90-degree rotation.
4. Analyze the transformation against the given rule options: The cabinet has neither remained unchanged nor rotated by 180 degrees. The transformation described matches the 90-degree rotation rule.

Let’s analyze the bottom three left-to-right transformations marked by (A), (B), and (C) step-by-step to match the top transformation:

1. In the top transformation, the cabinet rotates 90 degrees from an upright, closed position to a horizontal, open position.

2. Looking at transformation (A), the teddy bear is rotated, but it isn’t simply a 90-degree rotation; it flips to face the opposite direction, likely a 180-degree rotation in the plane of the image.

3. Transformation (B) shows the teddy bear rotating, but it doesn’t open like the cabinet. Instead, it changes orientation slightly, presumably less than 90 degrees since it is still largely facing the same direction.

4. Transformation (C) features the teddy bear starting in a sitting position and then lying on its side in the second image. This is a 90-degree rotation similar to the cabinet going from a vertical closed position to a horizontal open position, despite the fact that the teddy bear isn't opening like the cabinet.

5. None of the transformations exactly replicate both the rotation and the state change (opening) of the cabinet, but transformation (C) is the closest match as it involves a 90-degree rotation without changing the number, size, or color of the object.

Given that the rotation is the primary aspect of the transformation (as the state change isn't listed in the rules), (C) is the most similar to the",1,1,1

In the transformation on the top of the puzzle, we have a closed wardrobe on the left that becomes an open wardrobe on the right. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- Size: The size of the wardrobe doesn't change from left to right.

- Color: The wardrobe maintains the same color in both pictures.

- Number: There is only one wardrobe in both pictures, so the number of objects does not change.

- Orientation: The change that occurs is in the orientation of the wardrobe doors. Initially, they are closed, and in the second image, they are open.

Therefore, the rule that best describes the transformation on top is the orientation of objects.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

In the transformation at the top of the puzzle, we see a closed wardrobe on the left that becomes an open wardrobe on the right. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- Objects rotate by 90 degrees: The wardrobe does not rotate by any degrees; rather, its doors open from a closed position to reveal the inside. Therefore, the rotation rule is not directly applicable to the transformation observed.

- Objects rotate by 180 degrees: There is no 180-degree rotation; the wardrobe remains in the same position, only its doors open.

- No change between pictures: This is not accurate because there is a clear change from the first picture to the second; the wardrobe goes from being closed to being open.

Since we are focused on the change in orientation due to the doors opening rather than rotation, none of the given rotation-based rules entirely apply to the transformation observed. Given the options, the closest match that we could consider would be the wardrobe doors rotating on their hinges, which might be construed as a 90-degree rotation in the context of opening, but the wording of the rule suggests rotation of the entire object, not a part of it.

Thus, considering the specific wording of the rules provided and the actual transformation observed in the images:

(4) Doesn't apply

The given rules pertain to rotation of the entire object, and since the actual change is the opening of the wardrobe doors, rather than a rotation of the entire wardrobe","(A)

In the transformation at the top of the puzzle, we have a wardrobe that transitions from being closed to being open, which is an alteration in the orientation of the door components of the object.

Now, let's compare each of the three transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to determine which one matches this change in orientation:

- (A) shows a stuffed dog that transitions from sitting to lying on its back. This represents a change in the orientation of the dog.

- (B) depicts a stuffed dog that flips from its back to its feet. This is an orientation change, but it involves the dog being upside down in the middle frame, which is not an analogous transformation to the opening of a door.

- (C) shows two images of a stuffed dog with no change in its orientation or any other characteristic between the two images.

Only option (A) mirrors the change in orientation seen in the top transformation, where the wardrobe doors go from closed to open, representing a similar concept to the dog that moves from a sitting to a lying position. The other options either do not match the type of change (B involves an extra intermediate flip, and C has no change), or do not involve a change in orientation that reflects the opening of a door (which is what the wardrobe does). Thus, (A) is the correct answer.",1,1,1

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the top part of the image, you see a cabinet on the left and the same cabinet on the right, but in the right picture, the cabinet is open, revealing the inside shelves.

2. Comparing the two images, the size of the cabinet does not change, so rule (1) does not apply.

3. The color of the cabinet remains the same between the two images, so rule (3) does not apply.

4. There is a change between the pictures; the cabinet goes from being closed to open, so rule (4) is not correct.

5. The change that occurs is in the orientation of the object: the cabinet's orientation shifts from being seen from the front to being seen from an angle that exposes the interior, which involves rotation. Hence, the correct rule is the orientation of the object (2).","The rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle where the picture on the left transforms to the picture on the right is (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the cabinet on the top left, it is positioned upright with the door facing us. In the top right image, the cabinet is still upright, but the door is open, showing the shelving inside. This means the door has undergone a rotation.

2. The door has swung open from being fully closed (flush with the cabinet front) to being fully open (such that the inside of the door is now visible). This transition can be conceptualized as if the door has rotated 180 degrees around its vertical axis. From closed to a fully open position, the cabinet's door would typically make a 180-degree rotation by standard mechanics.

3. The rotation is not merely 90 degrees because a door opened 90 degrees would project outwards, still showing the exterior side of the door, not the interior. Thus, rule (1) is not applicable.

4. Clearly, there is a change between pictures, indicating that rule (3) is incorrect.

5. Since we have accounted for a specific change in orientation that matches a 180-degree rotation, rule (4) ""Doesn't apply"" is also incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is (2) Objects rotate by 180 degrees.","The transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle is (C).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the transformation at the top of the puzzle, the cabinet's orientation has changed by a 180-degree rotation, with the door moving from a closed to an open position around its vertical hinge axis.

2. We will now look at each set of transformations at the bottom of the puzzle to see which one matches the transformation seen at the top.

   - (A) shows a stuffed dog first seated upright, then on its back. The dog appears to be lying down, but not simply rotated around a vertical axis like the cabinet doors at the top; it involves repositioning in space in a way that is different from the cabinet's door rotation.

   - (B) shows a stuffed dog first seated upright, then on its side. Similar to (A), the dog is not just rotated around a vertical hinge but repositioned onto its side.

   - (C) shows a stuffed dog seated upright, then flipped upside down. This is the closest match to a 180-degree rotation around a vertical axis, as seen with the cabinet door; even though the dog's rotation is along a horizontal axis, the principle of a 180-degree rotation remains consistent with the transformation at the top.

In the top part of the visual puzzle, there are two images of what appears to be a submarine. The transformation from the left image to the right image shows a change in the orientation of the submarine. The submarine in the left image is horizontal with its bow pointing to the left, and in the right image, the orientation has changed so that the submarine is vertical with its bow pointing upwards. There is no change in size, number, or color of the object—only its orientation has changed.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation depicted at the top of the visual puzzle involves the submarine object undergoing a rotation. Following a step-by-step examination:

1. Compare the orientation of the submarine in the left and right images.
2. Notice that the submarine on the left is horizontal with the bow pointing to the left.
3. Observe that the submarine on the right is vertical with the bow pointing upward.
4. Determine the angle of rotation needed to achieve this change in orientation.
5. Realize that the submarine has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the horizontal (left-facing) position to the vertical (upward-facing) position.

Therefore, the rule that best describes this transformation is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(C)

To find which transformation on the bottom matches the one on the top:

1. Recall that the top transformation involves a 90-degree rotation of the submarine.
2. Examine each pair of images on the bottom (A, B, and C) to see which one shows a similar 90-degree rotation.
3. (A) shows a fish rotating slightly, but not by 90 degrees.
4. (B) shows a fish flipping over, which would correspond to a 180-degree rotation if we assume it flipped over the horizontal axis.
5. (C) shows a fish that has been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, just like the submarine on top.

To solve this visual puzzle, I will examine the transformations of the object on the top from the left to the right:

1. The object on the top is a pen which first appears lying horizontally and then is shown standing vertically.
2. There is no change in color, size, or number of objects - only the orientation changes from horizontal to vertical.

Given these observations, the rule that best describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is the change in the orientation of objects, which corresponds to rule number (3).","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

To determine the rule that best describes the transformation in the top part of the puzzle, let's examine the object (pen) again:

1. Initially, the pen is oriented horizontally.
2. In the second image, the pen is oriented vertically. 

Analyzing the change in orientation:

- The pen rotates from lying flat to standing up. This rotation moves the object from a horizontal plane to a vertical plane.
- The amount of rotation necessary to achieve this change is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the rule that describes the transformation at the top of the puzzle is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees, which corresponds to rule number (1).","(C)

To match the left-to-right transformation of the object on the top of the puzzle to one of the three transformations (A), (B), or (C) at the bottom of the puzzle, let's examine them:

- The top transformation shows a rotation of the pen by 90 degrees from a horizontal to a vertical position without any other changes.
- We are looking for the same type of transformation among the options (A), (B), and (C).

Now, analyzing each option at the bottom:

(A) The fish rotates by somewhat less than 180 degrees between the first and second frames. This is not a 90-degree rotation, so (A) is not the same transformation.
(B) The fish rotates by exactly 180 degrees between the first and second frames. This is also not a 90-degree rotation, so (B) is not the same transformation.
(C) The fish rotates by 90 degrees between the first and second frames, similar to the pen on the top. This matches the type and amount of rotation seen in the top transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The object on the top transforms from a horizontally oriented submarine to a vertically oriented submarine.
2. The number of submarines remains the same (one) in both the left and right images, so rule (1) doesn't apply.
3. The size of the submarine doesn't change as both images feature a submarine of the same size, so rule (2) doesn't apply.
4. The color remains consistent between the two images; hence, rule (4) doesn't apply.
5. Since no other rules could describe the transformation apart from the change in orientation, rule (3) ""Orientation of objects"" is the best description of the transformation observed. The orientation of the submarine changes by 90 degrees clockwise from the left to the right image.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The submarine in the top sequence of the puzzle rotates from a horizontal position to a vertical position from left to right.
2. The rotation is a quarter turn, which corresponds to a 90 degree rotation.
3. This rotation does not equate to a 180 degree turn, so rule (1) doesn't apply.
4. There is a change between the pictures; the orientation differs, therefore rule (3) ""No change between pictures"" also doesn't apply.
5. Rule (4) is for situations where no other rules apply, which is not the case here.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The top sequence shows a submarine rotating by 90 degrees from a horizontal direction to a vertical direction.
2. We need to find a matching transformation among the options (A), (B), and (C) on the bottom that also shows an object rotating by 90 degrees.

Looking at the options:
- (A) shows a fish that has not changed its orientation; it remains facing the same direction in both pictures.
- (B) shows a fish that has been flipped over, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation, not a 90-degree rotation.
- (C) shows a fish that rotates by 90 degrees from the first to the second picture, just like the submarine at the top.

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
1. In the top transformation, we are shown a ship on the left and the same ship viewed from a different angle on the right. The ship itself does not change in color, number, or size; only the orientation, or angle from which we are viewing the ship, changes.

2. Looking at the bottom transformations, it is clear that they are examples of how the orientation of an object can change from one image to another, which is similar to what we see with the ship transformation. 

3. In (A), (B), and (C), there are no changes in the number of objects, color of objects, or any change suggesting a 'no change between pictures' scenario.

Therefore, the best rule to describe the top transformation is the orientation of objects, as indicated by the change in viewpoint for the ship from left to right.","(1) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
1. Examining the top transformation, we see a ship in the left image and a different perspective of the same ship in the right image. Notably, the ship has been rotated about a vertical axis.

2. The initial perspective of the ship in the left image shows the starboard (right) side of the ship, while in the right image, the perspective is from the stern (rear), displaying the ship's decks and interior details. This indicates a rotation, not a full flip or 180-degree turn.

3. The amount of rotation seems to be a quarter turn, which corresponds to a 90-degree rotation, as the view transitions from the side of the ship to the back.

Thus, the rule that best describes the top transformation of the ship from the left picture to the right is that the objects rotate by 90 degrees.","(B)

Step-by-step reasoning for this choice:
1. First, we've established from previous analysis that the ship on the top of the puzzle rotates by 90 degrees from left to right. So we are looking for a transformation at the bottom that matches this 90-degree rotation.

2. In option (A), the object appears to remain in the same orientation, and there's no discernible rotation between the two images.

3. In option (B), the object rotates around its vertical axis. The left image shows the front of the object, and the right image shows the side, consistent with a 90-degree rotation.

4. In option (C), the object has been rotated, but this appears to be a rotation of 180 degrees as it goes from facing up to facing down. This is not the same transformation as observed on the top.

Therefore, the bottom transformation that matches the top transformation (a 90-degree rotation) is marked by (B).",1,1,1
49,1,0,90,0,90,180,0,"(3) Orientation of objects

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Looking at the transformation on the top with the ship, the color of the object remains the same (brown and various other colors on the ship), which means rule (1) does not apply here.

2. The number of ships remains constant (one ship on the left and one ship on the right), so rule (2) is not the correct transformation rule for this case.

3. The orientation of the ship changes from the left picture to the right picture. In the left image, the ship is upright with its sails set high, while in the right image the ship is turned sideways with the sails collapsed and hull visible from a profile view. This change indicates that rule (3) applies.

4. Since there is an observable change (the orientation change), rule (4) is not applicable because there is a distinct and intentional transformation occurring between the pictures.

5. We can clearly see there is a rule that applies, so rule (5) is not relevant in this case.

Conclusively, the left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle depicts a change in the orientation of objects, which aligns with rule (3).","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Examining the top transformation featuring the ship, it is clear that the orientation of the ship changes between the picture on the left and the picture on the right. This change serves as a clue that a rotation has occurred.

2. To determine whether the ship has been rotated by 180 degrees, we need only look at the direction it is facing. If it were rotated by 180 degrees, the ship would still be upright but facing the opposite direction. However, this is not the case as in the right picture, the ship is seen from a side view as opposed to the front or back view. Therefore, rule (1) does not match the observed transformation.

3. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the ship on the left is shown with its bow (front) facing the viewer and its sails standing tall. The ship on the right is rotated such that the deck is visible and the sails are collapsed horizontally—indicating that the ship has been rotated around its horizontal central axis. A rotation of 90 degrees around this axis from an upright position would result in the profile view we observe in the right picture.

4. There is a change between the two pictures, so rule (3) does not apply here.

5. Given that we have identified a specific type of rotation, rule (4) does not apply because we can indeed classify the transformation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We have previously determined that the transformation at the top of the puzzle involves a 90-degree rotation around the horizontal axis. 

2. Now, let's examine the bottom transformations:

- (A) shows a conical object that rotates around its vertical axis between the two pictures. This does not match the top transformation's horizontal axis rotation.
  
- (B) displays a conical object that seems to rotate around its horizontal axis. In the left image, the object's narrower end points upwards, while in the right image, the narrower end points to the side, which matches the 90-degree rotation along the horizontal axis similar to the top transformation.
  
- (C) shows two images of a conical object with no rotation or change in orientation between them. Instead, the number of objects changes from one to two, so this does not correspond with the top transformation.

3. Since (B) is the only transformation that involves a 90-degree rotation around the object's horizontal axis, it matches the top transformation.

Therefore, the answer is (B), as it reflects the same type of transformation as the one on top of the puzzle: a 90-degree rotation around a horizontal axis.",1,1,0

The transformation involves the orientation of an object from the left image to the right image. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- The object on the top transforms from an upright ship on the left to a ship that is tipped over and seemingly sinking on the right.
- No change in color is present, as the ship remains the same color in both images.
- Size doesn't seem to be the factor, as the ship's size does not appear to vary significantly from the left image to the right one.
- There is no increase or decrease in the number of objects; there is still only one ship.
- Since the main change is in the way the ship is positioned, with the right image showing the ship at an angle compared to the left image where it's upright, the rule that best describes it is the orientation of the object.","(2) Objects rotate by 90 degrees

The transformation on the top of the puzzle shows a ship that has rotated from the left to the right. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- The ship on the left is initially upright, which is a typical orientation for a ship on the water.
- In the image on the right, the ship has tipped onto its side. The mast and sails that were vertical in the first picture are now horizontal, which indicates a 90-degree rotation about the axis of the ship.
- There is no indication of a 180-degree rotation because that would imply the ship is upside down, which it is not.
- There is clearly a change between the two pictures, so options (3) and (4) are not applicable.

- Looking at the bottom transformations:
    - (A) shows an object that is rotating, but the angle of rotation between the first and second image is not 90 degrees; it is less than that.
    - (B) shows an object that rotates by 90 degrees from the first to the second image, just like the ship on the top.
