The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a change in the number of objects. In the left picture, there are two objects, while in the right picture, there are one object. This change in the number of objects indicates that the transformation is following rule (2).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, there are two objects.
2. In the right picture, there is one object.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the number of objects. In the left picture, there are two objects, while in the right picture, there are three objects. This change in the number of objects indicates that the transformation is following rule (2) - the number of objects.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, there are two objects.
2. In the right picture, there are three objects.
3. The transformation involves a change in the number of objects, which is rule (2).

The puzzle's other transformations also follow the same rule, as the number of objects in the bottom pictures changes from one to three.</s>","(1) Things go down by 1

The left-to-right transformation in the top of the puzzle involves a change in the position of the objects. In the left picture, the objects are positioned higher, while in the right picture, the objects are positioned lower. This change in position indicates that the transformation is following rule (1) - things go down by 1.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, the objects are positioned higher.
2. In the right picture, the objects are positioned lower.
3. The transformation involves a change in position, which is rule (1).

The puzzle's other transformations also follow the same rule, as the objects in the bottom pictures move from the top to the bottom.</s>","(A)

The left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle marked by (A) is the same as the left-to-right transformation on the top of the puzzle. Both transformations involve a change in the position of the objects, with the objects moving from a higher position to a lower position.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. In the left picture, the objects are positioned higher.
2. In the right picture, the objects are positioned lower.
3. The transformation marked by (A) on the bottom of the puzzle involves a change in position, which is the same as the transformation on the top of the puzzle.

The other two transformations on the bottom of the puzzle do not follow the same rule, as they involve changes in the number of objects or orientation of the objects.</s>",1,1,0
