Therefore, the correct rule is (2) Orientation of objects.</s>","[Skipped mcq#2, incorrect previous response]","(A)

The left-to-right transformation on the bottom of the puzzle that is the same as the one on the top is the one marked by (A). The transformation involves a change in the orientation of the object, which is a characteristic of the transformation in the top row.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The left picture shows an object facing upwards.
2. The right picture shows the same object facing downwards.
3. The transformation between the left and right pictures involves a change in the orientation of the object.
4. The transformation marked by (A) on the bottom row also involves a change in the orientation of the object.

The left-to-right transformation on top of the puzzle involves a change in the color of the object. In the image, the object on the left is blue, while the object on the right is red. This indicates that the transformation is related to the color of the object, which is rule (2) - Color of objects.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The object on the left is blue.
2. The object on the right is red.
3. The transformation involves a change in color, which is rule (2) - Color of objects.
